Libya: plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse	利比亚：12 月 24 日总统选举计划接近崩溃
The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.	周日，利比亚在计划已久的 12 月 24 日举行首次总统选举的机会似乎几乎崩溃，因为监督投票的机构表示，由于持续受到法律方面的质疑，无法宣布获得批准的候选人。
With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.	距离选举还有不到两周的时间，而且几乎没有时间进行竞选活动，因此推迟选举将严重打击国际社会重新统一这个严重分裂国家的希望。
Foreign powers will also fear the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.	外国势力也会担心民主的整体势头可能会消散。
In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war.	在短期内，他们将不得不就临时政府是否继续存在达成一致，以填补政治真空并防止内战卷土重来。
A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission's decisions to block high-profile figures including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former dictator, from standing for the presidency.	一系列法院裁决推翻了利比亚选举委员会阻止包括前独裁者之子 Saif al-Islam Gaddafi 在内的知名人士竞选总统的决定。
The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have meanwhile been approved by the commission but subsequently appealed by other parties.	临时总理 Abdul Hamid Dbeibah 和自封为利比亚国民军的军阀Khalifa Haftar 同时获得了委员会的批准，但随后受到其他各政党的上诉。
It said in a statement on Saturday it said could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was "keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."	在周六的一份声明中提到，无法在近 100 名已申请的候选人中公布获批候选人的姓名，因为它“渴望用尽所有诉讼手段，以确保做出的决定符合已发布的判决。”
Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.	敌对派系相互指责对方恐吓或贿赂司法官员以确保他们的候选人恢复原状，委员会正在调查这些决定是否有效。
In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force.	对于 Dbeibah，他曾承诺作为临时总理的条件，他不会参选，但此后在法庭上辩称这是一个没有法律效力的道德承诺。
Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi.	Saif Gaddafi 于 2015 年因参与推翻其父亲 Muammar Gaddafi 的革命而被缺席宣判，罪名是战争罪。
He denies wrongdoing.	他否认有不当行为。
The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized.	数以万计的外国战士、雇佣军和土著民兵的存在使该国成为一个火药桶，人们担心让有争议的候选人参选只会导致不被认可的结果。
In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel.	作为对外国势力紧张局势的一个迹象，法国正在敦促欧盟周一同意对俄罗斯私人军事承包商 Wagner Group 实施制裁，据称该公司在利比亚和萨赫勒地区开展业务。
Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens.	莫斯科否认瓦格纳与俄罗斯政府有关联，并表示将报复欧盟对其公民的制裁。
The international community's ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post.	国际社会要求利比亚政治阶层坚持 2 月首次商定的 12 月 24 日选举日期，这一能力受到了任命联合国特使 Ján Kubiš 的阻碍，后者在选举前三周辞职，他在任不到一年。
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy, to act as his special adviser.	联合国秘书长 António Guterres 此后任命了强势的前联合国副特使 Stephanie Williams 担任他的特别顾问。
Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections.	俄罗斯否决了她作为正式特使的任命，但她对利比亚有深入的了解，去年表现出与反对选举的政治阶层对抗的意愿。
The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections.	联合国代表团发表声明，敦促各方不要扭转取得的成果，指出近 300 万选民登记、选民卡成功发放大量候选人参选总统和议会，种种迹象表明民众非常支持选举。
The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said "refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power."	美国驻利比亚大使 Richard Norland 表示，“拒绝参加选举并动员起来阻挠只会让利比亚的命运和未来受制于那些喜欢打仗而不是民主的外部支持者。”

South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk	南非向最后一位种族隔离领袖德克勒克致敬
South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy.	周日，南非正式向白人统治的最后一任总统威廉·德克勒克致敬，他将纳尔逊·曼德拉从监狱中释放出来，并带领该国从种族隔离走向民主。
De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer.	德克勒克在与癌症作斗争后于 11 月 11 日去世，享年 85 岁。
Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.	为了纪念他，宣布全国哀悼四天。
He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994.	他从 1989 年到 1994 年担任总统，并因领导南非从白人少数统治过渡到 1994 年的第一次多种族选举而被人们铭记。
De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.	德克勒克在 1990 年将曼德拉从监狱中释放出来后，还与曼德拉同获 1993 年的诺贝尔和平奖。
Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.	曼德拉在其非洲国民大会党赢得 1994 年大选后成为南非第一位黑人总统。
President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor.	总统西里尔·拉马福萨周日上午出席了开普敦新教格鲁特教堂（南非最古老的教堂之一），为德克勒克致悼词。
"He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees.	德克勒克的遗孀 Elita Georgiadis 告诉大约 200名与会者：“由于他矫枉过正，他经常被误解”。
I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him.	我永远不会忘记这个让我着迷的人，他让我想帮助他完成这项艰巨的任务。
A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers.	仪式前举行了一场私人弥撒和奏国歌活动，两支蜡烛之间有一张德克勒克的肖像，唱诗班上装饰着白花。
Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions.	尽管在国外享有良好的声誉，但德克勒克在南非的意见分歧很大，他的去世引起了不同的反应。
Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.	批评者说，他仍然与种族隔离时代的罪行密不可分，如果他活得更久，可能会被追究责任。
De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority.	德克勒克代表国民党，该党于 1948 年正式确立种族隔离制度，剥夺了非白人在南非的多数权利。
Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.	在教堂外，一小群抗议者举着标语牌，上面写着“拒绝伸张正义”和“为种族隔离受害者伸张正义”，他们很快被警方带走。
The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.	周围地区禁止通行，并处于高度安全状态。
Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid.	德克勒克晚年的言论也玷污了他的形象，人们批评他没有为种族隔离罪行正式道歉。
In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing.	2020 年，他否认种族隔离是反人类罪，然后撤回声明并道歉。
De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.	德克勒克的基金会发布了一段死后视频，为“种族隔离给南非的非白人群体造成的痛苦、伤害、侮辱和损害”道歉。

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5	华盛顿州滑雪场雪崩致 1 人死亡，5 人被困
An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others.	周六，一场雪崩席卷了华盛顿州滑雪胜地的一部分，该滑雪胜地曾用于野外滑雪，造成一名 60 岁男子死亡，另外五人暂时被困。
The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss.	皮尔斯县治安警察局警官 Darren Moss 说，雪崩是在上午 10 点 50 分左右在水晶山 Silver Basin 地区发生的，该地区位于西雅图东南约 85 英里（137 公里）。
The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier.	死者的身份尚未公布，但当局表示，他被从雪地里拉出来后没有呼吸，尽管另一名滑雪者对他进行了心肺复苏，但没能将其救活。
The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow.	同组中的其他滑雪者在两名目击者的帮助下自救，目击者看到这两位滑雪者被雪卷起来。
All were wearing avalanche beacons.	所有人都携带着雪崩信标。
While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort.	尽管所有陷入雪崩的人都是经验丰富的野外滑雪者，但该地区已发出警告，禁止在水晶山度假村边界内滑雪。
The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.	私人滑雪胜地安排了滑雪场地，但没有什么可以阻止滑雪者去界外，因为该度假酒店毗邻贝克山-史诺瓜米国家森林的公共土地。
Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.	度假村总裁兼首席执行官 Frank DeBerry 表示，所有六名男子都持有滑雪度假村的上坡旅行通行证，这意味着他们已在滑雪巡逻队那里登记，参加了关于如何以及在何处通过度假酒店进入野外滑雪的培训，并被要求在游览之前检查雪况。
"Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest.	“滑雪者可以在国家森林中随意旅行。
They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said	他们已经进入森林，但最终回到了滑坡发生的度假村边界，”DeBerry 说，
In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour).	除了关闭发生滑坡的区域外，度假村还在当天早些时候关闭了山脉雪上缆车，因为风速达到每小时 100 英里（每小时 161 公里）。
The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall.	雪崩发生在本季的第一场大雪之中。
The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters).	该地区在周日上午之前一直处于冬季风暴警告之下，国家气象局表示，在 2,000 英尺（610 米）以上的地区，可能会有 12 到 15 英寸（38 厘米）的降雪。
"We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm.	“我们的赛季开局较晚，现在我们已经从几乎没有雪变成了一场巨大的暴风雪。
People got excited," DeBerry said.	人们很兴奋，”DeBerry 说。
"We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk."	“我们都必须记住，这是一项有风险的运动。”
Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).	水晶山是华盛顿州最大的滑雪胜地，占地 2,600 英亩（1,052 公顷）。

Oh, so glad you asked, I have a lot to say about this.	哦，很高兴你这么问，我有很多话要说。
Yes, there’s been a pretty drastic change.	是的，发生了相当大的变化。
I have been overweight/obese since I was 3 years old, so existing like that is all I ever knew until age 30.	我从 3 岁开始就超重/肥胖，所以直到 30 岁我才知道这样的存在。
The vast majority of my family and friends who knew me before treat me the same and are SO.	以前认识我的绝大多数家人和朋友都对我一视同仁，而且
damn.	对我
supportive.	很支持。
I do have a select few familial relationships, which were strained to begin with, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.	我的家庭关系确实从一开始就很紧张，我的减肥似乎加剧了现有的问题。
This could be the result of their complexes or mine, because I think they’re used to being able to shit on me and I, in turn, am now even less willing to take their shit.	这可能是他们的情绪或我的情绪造成的，因为我认为他们习惯于对我指责，而我现在更不愿意接受他们的指责。
One person in particular has, very weirdly, tried to take credit for my weight loss.	特别是一个人，非常奇怪地试图将我减肥归功于他。
Basically, they’ve insinuated that they were the driving force that got me here, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs.	基本上，他们含沙射影地说，他们打着支持的幌子，说他们是我来到这里的驱动力，而事实上，他们甚至不知道我一直在做这些改变，直到我完成了 RNY 的训练，减掉了100多磅。
In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because I just didn’t want them to try to take control and bully me into things like I used to let them.	事实上，他们是最后一个知道的，我是故意的，因为我只是不想让他们试图控制和欺负我，就像我过去让他们做的那样。
Unsurprisingly, now they’ve taken to insulting my other features, like telling me my nose and forehead look too big since I lost weight and that I need a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.	不出所料，现在他们开始侮辱我的其他特征，比如说我减肥后鼻子和前额看起来太大了，还说我需要做鼻子整形和整刘海来修复 - 这是他们的典型行为。
At first, they just private messaged me these things but when I didn’t respond, they took to commenting about it publicly on social media, with no shame.	起初，他们只是私下告诉我这些事情，但当我没有回应时，他们开始在社交媒体上大言不惭地公开评论。
When I was bigger, that would have destroyed me and I would have listened but now I just ignore it.	当我长大时，那会毁了我，我会倾听，但现在我只是忽略它。
Luckily, my skin is thicker now (not just cause it’s in excess these days).	幸运的是，现在我的皮肤变厚了（不仅仅是因为这些天皮肤松弛）。
The attention from strangers is by far the weirdest part for me.	陌生人的关注对我来说是迄今为止最奇怪的。
When I was bigger, people really didn’t pay me any attention.	当我长大时，人们真的没有注意到我。
Like, little to no eye contact.	就像，几乎没有目光接触。
No saying hello or smiling at me as we pass on the street unless they knew me.	当我们在街上经过时，除非他们认识我，否则不会对我打招呼或微笑。
Definitely no going out of their way to help or compliment me.	绝对不要特意帮助或赞美我。
It was more isolating than I realized because it’s what I was used to.	这比我意识到到的更孤立，因为我已经习惯了。
I knew people could be judgmental of my size - with many doing so openly - but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro-level of it and just how subtle it can come about.	我知道人们可能会对我的身材进行评判 - 很多人都公开这样做，但在我减肥之后，我才意识到它的微观层面以及它的微妙程度。
Not only was I unaware of it, simply because it’s what I was used to, but I also don’t think those who perpetuate it are actively aware they’re doing it.	我不仅没有意识到这一点，仅仅是因为这是我习惯的，而且我也不认为那些让它永久化的人会主动意识到他们在这样做。
I really believe it is a subconscious bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in media, that many people just don’t realize they project.	我真的相信这是一种潜意识的偏见，媒体对超重人群的描述和态度滋生并加剧了这种偏见，许多人只是没有意识到他们的投射。
Now, it feels like everyone everywhere looks at me, smiles at me, talks to me, etc.	现在，感觉好像每个人都在看着我，对我微笑，和我说话，等等。
Both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to/get to know me - and that’s just platonically.	男人和女人与我的交往方式都不一样，都在努力与我交谈/了解我 - 这只是柏拉图式的。
Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like… everyone lol.	浪漫的是，我的约会范围已经从很少有人愿意和我在一起看到的东西，扩大到感觉…每个人都笑了。
It is DAUNTING.	这令人望而却步。
I assumed that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience.	我认为，至少，我曾经病态肥胖，体重减轻后，现在皮肤松弛，这一事实会让一些人望而却步，但是，尽管我把我的减肥和皮肤松弛放在了最重要的位置（因为我不想让它成为一个秘密），以我的经验来看，它还是使任何人感到没有担忧/知难而退。
It seems to have done the opposite and made them more interested, actually.	事实上，这似乎起到了相反的作用，这使他们更感兴趣。
Huge shock to me.	让我大为震惊。
I do have to put a little PSA here, though, for men who are newly talking to/dating a woman who has lost weight: comments like “I am so happy you lost the weight, you clearly haven’t realized how gorgeous you are yet” is NOT the way to go.	不过，对于刚刚与减肥女性交谈/约会的男性来说，我必须在这里附上一句：像“我很高兴你减肥了，你显然还没有意识到自己有多漂亮”这样的评论是不可取的。
I have heard some variation of this more times than I care to count and they all thought it was a compliment.	我听到过无数次有关这种变化的夸奖，他们都认为这是一种恭维。
Hey r/Military!	聊一下军事！
I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries.	我来自一个强制服兵役的国家，我只是想知道其他国家/地区的情况如何。
Hello everyone!	大家好！
I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force.	我来自爱沙尼亚，我是国防军的一员。
Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29.	在这里，所有 16 到 29 岁的男性都必须服兵役。
You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60.	必须完成 8 或 11 个月的训练，然后被送往“预备队”，直到年满 60 岁。
In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year.	在 60 岁之前，国防军有资格要求你每年参加一次或两次军事演习，每年约 2 周。
However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission.	但是，您不会被强迫去国外执行任务。
If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such.	如果您想这样做，您必须加入“童子军营”，在那里您将成为一名有薪水的职业军人。
I am just wondering how is it for other countries?	我只是想知道其他国家/地区的情况如何？
If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country?	例如，如果您在美国或英国参军，那么您是否被要求去另一个国家/地区作战？
What do you guys think about mandatory military service?	对于义务兵役，您们怎么看？
During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada.	2018 到 2019 年，我在 Tapa 训练期间，也有来自英国、美国、法国、比利时、丹麦和加拿大的单位。
Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military.	不幸的是，我们真的没有太多社交时间，我也没有亲自去问那些人，他们在自己国家/地区的军队服役是什么感觉。
I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well.	我知道这个子版块中可能主要是北约成员国成员，但如果能听到其他（非北约）国家/地区的声音，也会很有趣。
Sorry for my poor grammar.	对不起，我的语法不好。
English is my second language.	英语是我的第二语言。
You can also reset it from there.	您也可以从那里重置它。
However I recommend you resetting it from your computer, even if you are logged in on your computer, this is for you to remember your password, as this information is important to know by memory	但是，即使您已在计算机上登录，我也建议您在计算机上重置密码，这是为了让您记住密码，因为凭记忆了解这个信息很重要
Once your password is reset from your computer, please try accessing once again on our daughter's e-reader with your new password	在计算机重置密码后，请尝试使用新密码在孩子的电子阅读器上再次访问
please let me know if it works	请告诉我是否起作用
I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried.	我很喜欢这样的文章，它帮助我解开了一张错综复杂的、反社会的、自大的男人的网络，我父亲对这些男人赞不绝口，对他们中的众多领导人表示谴责。
Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills.	猜猜尼克松和卡特倒在了哪里，他的金童里根不能做坏事。
While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump,	虽然我早就知道这种世界观完全是胡说八道，事实上我鄙视从凯撒到波拿巴、尼克松、里根、布什和特朗普的每一个自大狂，
I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life.	我可以理解凯撒或拿破仑的历史意义，但他们经过净化的历史的准神圣性质使我在以后的生活中对他们产生了反感。
To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward.	直到今天，我仍然拒绝研究波兰的历史，因为那样只会让我父亲的妄想阴谋继续发展下去。
Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity.	回到这篇文章，我喜欢这些小细节，它们提醒您实际上有一个好的选择（尽管有较小的缺陷，但大多是出于善意），一方不好，没有本着诚意行事，恶意是比愚蠢更可能的解释。
That's the thing.	就是这样。
Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege.	共和党人喜欢躲在愚蠢的背后，而不是承认恶意，但如果一个政党的意识形态基础受到围攻，就不会犯错。
Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist.	那么，巧合和意外等事情就很少存在了。
The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts.	被围困的心态意味着每一个行动都必须有价值，否则您会将有限的精力花费在轻浮的行为上。
But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.	但共和党人喜欢躲在我们对世界更微妙的理解背后，试图扔掉各种各样的哲学剃刀。
Thank you for taking the time to chat to me today.	感谢您今天抽出宝贵时间与我聊天。
Once this chat has ended you will be sent a 'rate my chat' feedback email.	聊天结束后，您将立即收到一封“评价我的聊天”反馈电子邮件。
Please kindly fill this in if you have a moment, however if you don't have time then may I wish you a wonderful day and thank you again.	如果您有时间，烦请填写此反馈；但是，如果您没有时间，愿您度过美好的一天！再次感谢您。

Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time?	即使 Apple 提高了操作系统更新速度以解决少数应用程序中的小错误修复，为什么用户每次都需要执行“完整的操作系统升级”？

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again	Gabba 的双电源故障解释了为什么会再次发生
Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.	在下一个灰烬系列赛之前，Gabba 转播综合区固有的电力故障风险不太可能得到改善，因为板球当局正在等待有关体育场重大升级计划以举办 2032 年奥运会的更多细节。
Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.	消息人士告诉《时代报》和《悉尼先驱晨报》，Gabba 体育场是澳大利亚板球运动中唯一一个地面的主电源不足以启动在全球传输图片所需的大量广播卡车和设备。
Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.	为 Gabba 测试全球转播提供动力的主要和备用发电机在第四天关闭了大约 25 分钟。
That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.	这是因为该区域的基本电力需要为 Gabba 的灯塔（其中一个灯塔在 2019 年的一场 Big Bash League 比赛中臭名昭著地倒塌）和地面供电。
As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.	因此，广播公司从为测试比赛租用的大型柴油发电机获取主电源，而备用电源则来自备用发电机。
However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.	然而，在测试赛的第四天，主发电机与备用发电机发生故障，导致两者同时出现故障，导致转播画面和 DRS 全部或部分丢失近 30 分钟。
NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.	为 Fox 和 Seven 提供外部广播卡车和其他设施的公司 NEP 已向提供发电机的公司寻求说法。
All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.	用于灰烬的所有其他场地 - 阿德莱德椭圆形体育场、MCG、SCG 和霍巴特的贝勒里夫椭圆形体育场 - 将为转播公司提供主电源，而柴油发电机则作为备用电源。
This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.	这种差异在过去曾给主播 Fox Cricket 带来了极大的焦虑，这种差异在灰烬测试期间由于制作人员和技术人员的大量减少而加剧，因为制作人员和技术人员能够密切关注整个比赛期间保持在空中的无数隐喻球。
Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.	几个月来，Fox 警告 Cricket Australia 从技术上讲，在其他地方进行比赛会更安全，但如果继续留在 Gabba，允许进入昆士兰的骨干人员将面临“巨大的风险”。

Liz Truss pledges another £75m in aid to Afghanistan at G7 meeting	Liz Truss 在七国集团会议上承诺再向阿富汗提供 7500 万英镑的援助
A further £75 million in aid is to be given to Afghanistan by the UK to help address its worsening humanitarian situation, Liz Truss has announced.	Liz Truss 宣布，英国将进一步向阿富汗提供 7500 万英镑的援助，以帮助解决其日益恶化的人道主义局势。
The Foreign Secretary said the commitment would help save lives and "support stability in the region."	外交大臣表示，这一承诺将有助于挽救生命并“支持该地区的稳定”。
It follows discussions among G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool on Saturday about what co-ordinated action can be taken in Afghanistan, along with how to engage with the Taliban rulers.	周六，七国集团外长在利物浦讨论了可以在阿富汗采取哪些协调行动，以及如何与塔利班统治者接触。
The militant group stormed Kabul in a lightning advance in August, as 20 years of occupation of the central Asian country was brought to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal.	8 月，该激进组织闪电般突袭喀布尔，盟军匆忙撤离，结束了对这个中亚国家长达 20 年的占领。
Ms Truss said: "The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter.	Truss 女士说：“今年冬天，英国将在阿富汗提供重要的人道主义援助。
The funds announced today will save lives, protect women and girls and support stability in the region.	今天宣布的资金将拯救生命、保护妇女和女孩并支持该地区的稳定。
We are determined to do all we can for the people of Afghanistan."	我们决心为阿富汗人民尽我们所能。”
The additional financial support will bring the UK's commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.	额外的财政支持将使英国今年对阿富汗的承诺达到 2.86 亿英镑。
It will be used to provide support for victims of gender-based violence and to fund essential child protection services.	它将用来为性别暴力受害者提供支持，并为基本的儿童保护服务提供资金。
The United Nations and aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk including households headed by women and disabled people, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said (FCDO).	外交、联邦和发展办公室 (FCDO) 表示，联合国和援助机构将优先考虑那些最危险的人，包括以妇女和残疾人为户主的家庭。
Officials said no funding would go directly through the Taliban, instead being funnelled through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme (WFP) and other organisations.	官员们表示，任何资金都不会直接通过塔利班，而是通过阿富汗人道主义基金、世界粮食计划署 (WFP) 和其他组织提供。
The WFP will receive £34 million of the funding announced on Sunday.	世界粮食计划署将从周日宣布的资金中获得 3400 万英镑。
David Beasley, the organisation's executive director, said the donation would "help us save many lives."	该组织的执行董事 David Beasley 表示，这笔捐款将“帮助我们挽救许多生命”。
"What we are seeing on the ground is heart-breaking - 23 million people are facing severe hunger in a country crippled by drought, conflict and an economic crisis," he said.	“我们在当地看到的情况令人心碎 - 在一个遭受干旱、冲突和经济危机重创的国家，2300 万人正面临严重饥饿”，他说。
"Women and children are bearing the brunt of this suffering and, as the harsh winter descends, more and more are slipping into malnutrition and starvation each day."	“妇女和儿童首当其冲地承受着这种痛苦，随着严冬的到来，天都有越来越多的人陷入营养不良和饥饿中。”
This week the UN's humanitarian chief warned that Afghanistan's economic collapse was "happening before our eyes" and urged the international community to take action to stop "the freefall" before it leads to more deaths.	本周，联合国人道主义事务负责人警告说，阿富汗的经济崩溃“发生在我们眼前”，并敦促国际社会采取行动阻止“自由落体”，以免导致更多人死亡。
Martin Griffiths said: "It's getting more and more dire by the week."	Martin Griffiths 说：“本周变得越来越可怕。”
The funding announcement comes after ministers this week faced awkward questions about the Afghan withdrawal effort following a whistleblower's evidence to MPs.	在宣布拨款之前，部长们本周在向国会议员提供举报人证据后，面临有关阿富汗撤军努力的尴尬问题。
Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed just 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help as a result of the "dysfunctional" and "chaotic" handling of the situation.	在“皮廷行动”期间，Raphael Marshall 为外交部工作，他声称，在根据一项英国计划申请逃难的阿富汗国民中，只有 5% 的人因对局势的“不正常”和“混乱”处理而得到了帮助。
Mr Marshall told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that some of those hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.	Marshall 先生告诉下议院外交事务委员会，一些希望逃跑的人在被留在喀布尔后被谋杀。
He also claimed Boris Johnson requested that "considerable capacity" was made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by former Royal Marine Paul "Pen" Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk to help aid their departure on a privately funded plane.	他还声称 Boris Johnson 要求提供“相当大的能力”来疏散由前皇家海军陆战队成员 Paul "Pen" Farthing 经营的庇护所中的动物（以帮助它们乘坐私人资助的飞机离开），这使得部队工作人员的生命处于危险之中。
The Prime Minister has called the claims "complete nonsense."	总理称这些说法“完全是胡说八道”。
At the Museum of Liverpool on Sunday, Ms Truss will have discussions with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them virtually.	周日，在利物浦博物馆，Truss 女士将与首次参加七国集团峰会的东南亚国家联盟的外长进行讨论 - 其中大部分都是虚拟会议。
The Foreign Secretary will stress the importance of working with south-east Asia's "economies of the future" to tackle the current challenges facing the West, the FCDO said.	FCDO 表示，外交大臣将强调与东南亚“未来经济体”合作以应对西方当前所面临挑战的重要性。
The invitation to Asian ministers comes after the UK's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a "tilt" towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region.	在向亚洲各国部长发出邀请之前，英国于 3 月份发布了《外交政策综合评估报告》，宣布将向印度-太平洋地区“倾斜”，此举被视为旨在对抗中国在该地区日益增长的影响力。

Russia warned of 'consequences' if Ukraine attacked	俄罗斯警告称，如果乌克兰发动袭击，将会产生“后果”
The Group of Seven has warned Russia of massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladimir Putin attacks Ukraine, according to a draft statement.	根据一份声明草案，七国集团已警告俄罗斯，如果弗拉基米尔·普京总统袭击乌克兰，将面临巨大后果和沉重代价。
US intelligence assesses that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops.	美国情报部门估计，俄罗斯最早可能计划在明年对乌克兰发动多线进攻，涉及多达 175,000 名士兵。
The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia.	克里姆林宫否认它计划入侵，并表示西方受到俄罗斯恐惧症的困扰。
Moscow says the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.	莫斯科表示，北约的扩张威胁到俄罗斯，并违背了在 1991 年前苏联解体时对俄罗斯做出的保证。
At a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, the G7 delegates said they were united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up near Ukraine and they called on Moscow to de-escalate.	在英国北部城市利物浦的一次会议上，七国集团代表表示，他们一致谴责俄罗斯在乌克兰附近的军事集结，并呼吁莫斯科缓和局势。
"Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost," the draft statement said, confirmed by G7 sources.	七国集团消息人士证实，声明草案称：“毫无疑问，俄罗斯对乌克兰的进一步军事侵略将产生巨大的后果和沉重的代价。”

These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets.	这两个航天飞机舱由一个可以容纳原尺寸航天飞机套装的原尺寸工作室套装代表。
I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it.	当剧情展示双航天飞机舱中段、颈部或任何您想称呼它的区段的后部时，我总是特别喜欢。

Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13.	驾驶台的工作人员不会去那里，而是乘坐涡轮电梯直接经过它，一直下到第 13 层甲板。
In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life.	在最初的《星际迷航》中，建造了一个微型装置并将其与微型航天飞机一起使用，以赋予航天飞机舱生命。
Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life.	有时可以看到人物在通向航天飞机舱间的门前交谈，微型套装和航天飞机装置叠加在一起，赋予飞船规模和生命。

The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."	我们唯一一次看到与原物同尺寸的航天飞机舱是在“因果关系”中。
We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles.	我们看到卷帘门门打开、主航天飞机舱减压的太空照片，我们很快就看到里面停着几架航天飞机。
Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?	如何解释为什么在这两个实例之外从未见过主航天飞机舱？

French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row	在英国退欧后的捕鱼区中，法国渔民威胁要中断英国进口
French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights.	随着法国和英国在脱欧后捕鱼权问题上的紧张局势升级，法国渔民威胁要中断英国进口，试图向伦敦施压以获得更多许可证。
The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months.	周六，英国同意向法国渔民额外发放 23 个许可证，以缓解这两个邻国之间的紧张关系，过去六个月来，这两个邻国在捕鱼区问题上一直争吵不休，几个小时后，法国渔民发出了这一威胁。
France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year.	根据去年签署的英国脱欧协议，法国正力求再获得 81 个许可证，以达到其船只在英国和海峡岛水域运营所需的 104 个许可证。
The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough.	欧盟已规定 12 月 10 日为伦敦按照脱欧协议向法国渔船发放许可证的最后期限，巴黎威胁称，如果没有突破，欧洲将采取法律行动。
Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests.	周六晚些时候，一个代表主要港口 Boulogne-sur-Mer 的渔民以及北海岸其他渔民的组织威胁要发起抗议，强调法国有权获得大约 80 多个英国执照。
"Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement.	“应该预料到抗议活动...将针对英国进口的抗议活动，”位于上法兰西地区的当地 CRPMEM 渔业组织在一份声明中表示。
The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue.	该组织表示，其成员对只有 23 个新许可证的消息感到“愤怒”，并感到被欧盟委员会“背叛”，欧盟委员会可能会就此问题对英国采取法律行动。
The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26."	CRPMEM 表示，抗议活动将“与 11 月 26 日对布列塔尼、诺曼底和法国北部港口的封锁一致”。
On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link.	当天，法国渔船在加莱、圣马洛和乌伊斯特勒姆港短暂封锁了渡轮和其他船只，同时还派出车辆扰乱那些试图使用英吉利海峡隧道铁路的交通。

This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought.	当暴露于任何批判性思维时，这些东西就会消亡

After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help.	毕竟，我们已经对这些选票进行了法务审计和人工重新计票，但这并没用。
Should we just keep allowing them to "audit" votes until they get the results they want?	我们是否应该继续允许他们“审核”选票，直到他们得到他们想要的结果？

This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die.	故事到此结束，谎言就此消亡。

If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit.	如果这里没有产生结果，他们会要求进行另一次审核。
Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated.	或者他们会声称将破碎的选票喂给鸡，然后将鸡焚烧。

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says	德国称伊朗核协议的时间不多了
Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries.	德国外交部长在与七国集团国家的同行会晤后，周六警告说，距离找到恢复 2015 年世界大国与伊朗之间核协议的方法的时间已经不多了。
Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations.	谈判已在维也纳恢复，试图恢复核协议，双方都试图在就停止-启动谈判的最新交流后评估成功的前景。
"Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting.	“时间不多了，”德国外交部长 Annalena Baerbock 在英国利物浦对记者说，七国集团外长正在那里开会。
It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress.	情况表明，过去几天没有任何进展。
Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months.	Baerbock 表示，伊朗已恢复谈判，它仍坚持立场，这使谈判推迟了六个月。
The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi.	在强硬的反西方主义者 Ebrahim Raisi 选为伊朗总统后，本轮在维也纳举行的会谈暂停了五个月。
Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks.	早些时候，美国官员表示，国务卿 Blinken 周五与英国、德国和法国的同行举行了一次“富有成效的”会议，讨论了伊朗会谈的前进方向。
A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks.	美国国务院一名高级官员表示，七国集团国家之间进行了“激烈”的对话，这些国家在核谈判上的立场是一致的。
"The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said.	这位不知姓名的官员在向记者通报情况时说：“该声明还将强调让伊朗重返谈判桌的重要性，并且有可能达成协议，但时间正在缩短，因此我们在这方面团结一致”。
The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks.	该官员补充说，美国的伊朗问题特使 Iran Robert Malley 正返回维也纳进行会谈。
Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance.	伊朗官员此前曾表示，他们将坚持强硬立场。
Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions.	根据时任总统 Donald Trump 于 2018 年放弃的原始核协议，伊朗限制其核计划，以换取对美国、欧盟和联合国制裁的缓解。
The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies.	西方担心该计划将被用于开发武器，德黑兰对此予以否认。
Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported.	据官方 IRNA 通讯社报道，Raisi 周六表示，德黑兰在维也纳举行的核谈判中是认真的。
The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord.	由于德黑兰拒绝与华盛顿直接接触，来自法国、英国、德国、俄罗斯和中国的外交官在美伊之间的间接会谈中穿梭，旨在让双方恢复全面遵守该协议。
The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.	预计七国集团会议将共同呼吁伊朗放缓其核计划并抓住维也纳会谈的机会。

Shiba Inu is the latest meme-crypto to go viral and despite being down almost 60% from it's all-time high, the market cap still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto in the world by valuation.	柴犬币是最新的病毒式模因加密货币，尽管从历史最高点下跌了近 60%，但市值仍保持在令人瞠目结舌的 200 亿美元，使其成为全球第 12 大加密货币。
A $100 investment at launch would be worth over $2 million today!	一项 100 美元的启动投资今天将价值 200 多万美元！
Many are no doubt kicking themselves for missing out on such gains, but the reality is that a bet on Shiba Inu was a pure gamble.	许多人无疑会因为错过这些收益而自责，但现实情况是，对柴犬币的赌注是一场纯粹的赌博。
Shiba's run was a combination of some very smart marketing and a whole lot of hype, that led droves of investors, with FOMO (fear of missing out) to pile into the meme-coin.	柴犬币的经营将高明营销和大量炒作结合在一起，这导致了大批投资者因害怕错过而涌入模因币。
Even the name itself, which was a homage to Elon Musk backed Dogecoin, was all part of the design.	即使是这个名字本身，它是对埃隆·马斯克支持的狗狗币的致敬。
In reality, Shiba Inu offers no tangible utility or value, with seemingly little effort to do so in the future.	实际上，柴犬币并没有提供任何有形的实用性或价值，而且在未来似乎很少努力做到这一点。
Being on the Ethereum blockchain, there would've been plenty of opportunity for development had the team behind Shiba Inu been motivated to do so.	在以太坊区块链上，柴犬币将会有很多发展机会，但前提是其背后的团队有动力这样做。
There are, however, several cryptocurrencies that are working to rise above the pack, and back their popularity with real utility and fundamental value.	然而，有几种加密货币正在努力脱颖而出，并以真正的实用性和基本价值来支持它们的流行。
Just 10 weeks ago, EverGrow Coin ($EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain and marketing experts.	就在 10 周前，由经验丰富的金融、区块链和营销专家组成的团队推出了 EverGrow 币 ($EGC)
One ground-breaking element of their project is the fact the token pays a stable currency to holders.	他们项目的一个突破性元素是代币向持有者支付了稳定货币这一事实。
In the short time since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over $30 million of binance-pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegged 1-to-1 with the USD.	在推出后的短时间内，EverGrow 币的持有者已获得超过 3000 万美元的与币安挂钩的美元奖励，这是一种受监管的稳定货币，与美元 1 比 1 挂钩。
The project currently has 110,000 holders according to BSCScan.	根据 BSCScan，目前，该项目有 110,000 名持有者。
With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin quickly grew to over $1 billion in market-cap, but then a major data error on CoinMarketCap, just weeks into the launch, caused mass panic amongst investors.	凭借其革命性的合约，EverGrow 币的市值迅速增长到 10 亿美元以上，但 CoinMarketCap 发布几周后出现的一个重大数据错误，引起了投资者的大规模恐慌。
With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw EverGrow investors away from the project.	对于这样一个新项目，建立信任需要时间，而这种恐慌被一系列文章所利用，传闻是该项目的竞争对手支付了费用，使用不正确的数据试图将 EverGrow 投资者从该项目中撬走。
Over the next month, the errors remained unfixed, and EverGrow sunk to below $300 million in valuation.	在接下来的一个月里，错误仍未解决，EverGrow 的估值跌至 3 亿美元以下。
Yesterday, CoinMarket Cap placed an alert on EverGrow's page, confirming that the data error had been fixed.	昨天，CoinMarket Cap 在 EverGrow 的页面上发出警示，确认数据错误已得到修复。
The price has now stabilised, and signs of returning confidence saw an increase of 22% from the recent lows.	价格现已企稳，信心恢复迹象显示，价格较近期低点上涨了 22%。
However, EverGrow still remains well below the highs achieved before this error.	然而，EverGrow 仍远低于出现此错误之前达到的高点。
EverGrow is very different from Shiba Inu.	EverGrow 与柴犬币的区别很大。
In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet, and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place & Lending, designed to bring continuous value to investors.	除了美元奖励的明显好处外，该项目背后的团队已经在他们的网站上推出了一个 SWAP dApp，最近透露了即将发布的加密钱包，有望超越 Trust Wallet 或 Safemoon Wallet 提供的功能，并拥有一整套实用工具，从内容创建平台到 NFT 市场和借贷，旨在为投资者带来持续的价值。
Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?	EverGrow 币是下一个柴犬币吗？
With Shiba Inu, offering little to no utility, valued at around 66 times that of EverGrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and ground-breaking project like EverGrow to see some serious upside from their current low market cap.	柴犬币几乎没有提供任何实用价值，其价值约为 EverGrow 币的 66 倍，对于像 EverGrow 这样的创新和突破性项目，有一个明确的论表明，从目前的低市值中可以看到一些可观的上升空间。
If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptos to invest in for 2022.	如果该团队继续以其创新和透明度给加密社区留下深刻印象，并且能够摆脱 CoinMarketCap 错误在投资者之间蔓延的恐慌，那么 EverGrow 币很有可能成为 2022 年投资的顶级加密货币之一。
There's a circularity to it...	它有一个循环...
I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition.	我认为餐盒是一个疯狂的提议。
The math they do is just crazy.	他们的算法很疯狂。
"We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..." Madness.	“我们实际上是在省钱，因为我们不必出去买一整瓶酱油来尝试进行亚洲烹饪...” 疯狂。
I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth.	我认为在消费领域，利润率较低的更廉价商品是上层阶级以外的任何人经历任何形式工资增长的唯一原因。
Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper.	工资并没有真正上涨，而是在下降。
The problem is that we sold out the people below us.	问题是我们出卖了比我们阶层低的人。
I agree with you.	我同意您的看法。
Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better.	我们中的一些人至少需要放弃一些便利来让社会变得更美好。
Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...	即使我的收入水平不足以支付更多的税，我仍然可以少买一些更贵的东西，这样他们就可以由靠挣钱谋生的人制造，我愿意等几天才能拿得到，这样一些零工就不必拼命工作了...

Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance.	自从她懂事起，除了戴口罩、强迫洗手和保持距离之外，她一无所知。
On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not.	有几次（在各种封控情况下），当我看到她时，我不知道我是否应该吻她。
What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child?	什么样的消息会发送到小孩子的乐于接受新事务且超级警觉的大脑中？

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report	分子诊断测试可在 20 分钟内检测出奥密克戎变体：报告
Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants.	韩国研究人员已经开发出可以检测奥密克戎变体的分子诊断技术。
The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization.	目前这项技术的开发已经完成，预计商业化还需要一段时间。
POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online.	POSTECH 10 日宣布，由化学工程系 Lee Jung-wook 教授领导的研究小组开发出分子诊断技术，可以在 20-30 分钟内检测出奥密克戎变体，并将在网上公布结果。
Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus.	奥密克戎是一种变体，其刺突中有 26-32 个突变，通过新冠肺炎病毒感染细胞。
According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.	据研究团队介绍，分子诊断技术可以区分单核苷酸碱基的突变，因此可以检测出由 PCR 测试很难检测到的“隐匿奥密克戎”。
Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test.	目前，韩国疾病控制和预防中心正在使用三种方法来检测新冠肺炎变体：全基因组分析、目标 DNA（诸如刺突蛋白之类的突变）分析和 PCR 测试。
In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot.	就德尔塔变体而言，它可以通过当前的 PCR 测试检测到，但奥密克戎不能。
The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology.	这次新开发的技术不是读取 DNA 或 RNA 序列的测序方法，而是分子诊断技术。
The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection.	现有技术仅筛查病毒的特定区域，但分子诊断技术在设计上仅在新冠肺炎 RNA 存在时才引起核酸结合反应，从而实现快速检测。
According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes.	根据 Lee 教授的说法，奥密克戎在 PCR 测试中对 N 基因产生的信号很强，但对 S 基因产生的信号较弱。
In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.	在“隐匿奥密克戎”的案例中，N 和 S 基因均确认为阳性，因此很难与其他变体区分开来。
The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently.	分子诊断技术的工作机制与 PCR 不同，可有效检测奥密克戎变体。
Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour).	与每台设备通常处理多达 96 个样本的传统技术不同，新技术可以在 30 分钟内处理超过 125 个样本（每小时超过 250 个样本）。
In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.	此外，这项分子诊断技术不需要专门的设备，因此可以通过简单而又方便的方式制作诊断试剂盒。
As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future.	由于该方法可以在 4 天内开发出诊断试剂盒，因此即使将来出现新的变体或病毒，也有望迅速做出反应。
"I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee.	“我希望这项技术的公开能够帮助我们尽快恢复正常的日常生活，”Lee 教授说。
We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19.	我们将尝试快速诊断和应对新冠肺炎之后可能出现的新变体。
This technology is currently before commercialization.	该技术目前尚未商业化。
However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed.	但是，在目前尚未开发出奥密克戎 PCR 测试的情况下，它可以用作辅助。
Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials.	Lee 教授说：“我认为这项技术在经过临床试验后，将在明年下半年接近商业化。
The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."	我之所以披露这项技术，是为了与他人分享它，以开发更好的技术来战胜新冠肺炎，并让不发达国家/地区也分析新冠肺炎变体。”

I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks?	我不记得确切的物品，但好像是纸盘（或靠近它们的东西...塑料叉子？
straws?).	吸管？）。
Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7."	由于我负责一排客户，不能离开去帮她定位，所以我告诉她“我认为它们现在位于 7 号通道”。
Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off.	我甚至还没来得及用我的对讲机去问某人是否确定，她就气冲冲地走了。
Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there.	几分钟后，她突然回来告诉我，物品不在那里。

He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8.	他看起来很困惑，然后说：“好吧，也许他们在第 8 通道。
I'll help you find them, ma'am."	我会帮你找到它们的，女士。”
As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know".	当他们要走开时，她转向我说：“你应该明白，如果你不知道的话，最好不要告诉别人什么东西在哪里”。
Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line.	长话短说，她回到收银台，但去了另一条通道。
As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her."	当经理回来时，他俯身对我耳语：“它们在第 7 号通道，就像你告诉她的那样。”
HA....told you so!	哈...告诉过你的！

Water heater temp and bath issue.	热水器温度和洗澡问题。
My water heater is set pretty low.	我的热水器设置得相当低。

Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice!	编辑：感谢大家的建议！
I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick.	我把温度调高了一点，就成功了。
The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation.	关于沸腾效率低下的评论可能是正确的，尽管热水器一直在运行，但它的绝缘性很好。
It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.	这很难达到，所以我让它保持在那个温度，今天到此为止。

Boris Johnson teeters on edge of favour with Tory MPs	Boris Johnson 在保守党议员的支持率摇摇欲坠
Boris Johnson has long been considered a king of comebacks.	Boris Johnson 长期以来一直被认为是复出之王。
And some Tory MPs hope he'll continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plummeting poll ratings in the wake of a string of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid laws.	一些保守党议员希望，在唐宁街一系列政党藐视新冠病毒法律之后，他将设法摆脱民意支持率直线下降的局面，从而继续保持上升势头。
The prime minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying any rules were broken before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite.	更多的报道和证据出现表明情况相反之前，总理一再否认违反了任何规则，从而使自己陷入了困境。
First there was the video of No 10 aides laughing while they discussed a Christmas gathering on 18 December last year.	首先是 10 号助手在去年 12 月 18 日讨论圣诞节聚会时大笑的视频。
Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson's closest adviser, promised pictures had been taken of parties, and so with bated breath critics of the government waited for them to surface.	然后，曾经是 Johnson 最亲密顾问的 Dominic Cummings 承诺已经为派对拍照，因此政府的批评者屏息等待真相浮出水面。
When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No 10 and at home, it was not quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him, however.	周日发布的一张图片显示，Johnson 在屏幕上在家为从 10 号调入的工作人员举办了一场圣诞测验，这并不是一些人认为最终会刺伤他的确凿证据。
The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides who were dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat - not socially distanced from one another, and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households.	《星期日镜报》的图片显示，Johnson 带着两名助手，他们穿着金属丝和一顶圣诞帽 - 彼此之间没有社交距离，而且显然是在与家人交往的社交场合。
But it could have been worse.	但情况可能更糟。
There have been other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters in which people drank copious amounts of alcohol, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialised into the small hours, sources have told media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times.	据《卫报》、《镜报》、《英国广播公司》和《泰晤士报》等媒体透露，在 10 号和保守党总部还举办过其他派对，人们在派对上大量饮酒、玩派对游戏、交换圣诞老人的秘密礼物，并在凌晨进行社交活动。
Ministers will quietly breath a sigh of relief no pictures of these scenes have been leaked - yet.	部长们将悄悄地松一口气，这些场景的照片尚未披露。
While Johnson's attendance at the quiz broke the rules, according to Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and a former director of public prosecutions, Tory MPs think people will look at the photo and judge that it really shows him hosting a virtual quiz - a familiar sight during the pandemic.	根据工党领袖、前检察长 Keir Starmer 的说法，虽然 Johnson 出席测验违反了规定，但保守党议员认为人们会看这张照片并判断这确实表明他在主持一场虚拟测验 - 这在疫情期间很常见。
The staff, dialling in from other rooms in No 10 while drinking and not socially distancing, cannot be seen.	无法看到工作人员从 10 号的其他房间拨入、喝酒且未保持社交距离。
On Sunday Nadhim Zahawi insisted the picture was just an example of Johnson "thanking his staff" and used it to play down the party scandal as "hype."	周日，Nadhim Zahawi 坚称这张照片只是 Johnson“感谢他的员工”的一个例子，并坚称这张照片被用来将政党丑闻淡化为“炒作”。
He told LBC: "On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a PM in his office, with the two close people that work with him, with no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."	他告诉 LBC：“在那个头版，我认为听众会看到他的办公室里有一个 PM、两个和他一起工作的密接人员，没有酒精，花 10 到 15 分钟来感谢和激励他的员工，他们来这里是因为他们不能在家工作。”
Much damage has already been done, with mutinous MPs furious at the prime minister allowing a "one rule for them" narrative to take hold, from Cummings to Matt Hancock and more recently Owen Paterson.	已经造成了很大的破坏，从 Cummings 到 Matt Hancock 以及最近的 Owen Paterson，叛变的国会议员对总理允许“他们的一条规则”说法大发雷霆。
Johnson is teetering on the edge of favour with his own MPs; if further photos surface, they may push him over the edge.	Johnson 在自己的国会议员中的支持率摇摇欲坠，如果更多照片浮出水面，他们可能会将 Johnson 推到边缘。
As I can see here this rider came to your location at 12:39. he try to deliver this order until 12:52.	正如我在这里看到的，这位骑手在 12:39 来到您的收获地址。他尝试在 12:52 之前送货。
The rider try to leave the order on the Security but he did not accept it.	这位骑手尝试将将货留在保安处，但保安没有接受。
That is why the order was taken by the rider as he goes.	这就是为什么骑手在离开时还在拿着货的原因。
Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters	身着班克斯衬衫、支持推翻雕像的抗议者排起了长队
Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK.	在英国布里斯托尔，人们不顾一切地购买神秘街头艺术家班克斯设计的衬衫。
They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march.	他们获释是为了支持因在“黑人的命也是命”游行中推倒奴隶贩子雕像而受审的抗议者。
Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year.	去年，四名被控破坏布里斯托尔一座有争议的雕像的人受到审判，班克斯设计了限量版“纪念衬衫”来以纪念这次审判。
"All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram.	这位艺术家在 Instagram 上写道：“所有收益都归被告所有，这样他们就可以去喝一杯了。”
Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it.	这件衬衫在几家商店以 25 英镑（33 美元）加增值税的价格售出，每人仅限一件，需求量很大，人们排着长队争相购买。
An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers.	Twitter 上发布的一段近两分钟长的视频显示，顾客络绎不绝。
UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it.	英国媒体报道称，“数千人”急于通过购买灰色 T 恤为抗议者筹集资金，这款 T 恤上面有一个写着“布里斯托尔”的空底座。
It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade.	它指的是一座倒塌的青铜纪念碑，纪念 17 世纪参与跨大西洋奴隶贸易的商人 Edward Colston。
The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council.	被称为“科尔斯顿四人”的激进分子下周将在布里斯托尔刑事法庭受审，罪名是对属于市议会的一座纪念碑造成刑事破坏。
The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse."	这些男子均不认罪，被指控“无正当理由”将雕像弄倒。
Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city.	这位备受争议的商人的雕像在 2020 年 6 月遭到袭击，当时该市正在举行支持黑人生命问题 (BLM) 运动的抗议活动，一些人称赞他死后将钱留给各种慈善事业。
The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march.	损坏的基座和涂鸦雕像后来被市议会从布里斯托尔港收回，在骚乱期间它被扔在布里斯托尔港，并作为当地博物馆的展览重新出现，同时还展出了一批由土地管理局策划的游行海报。
A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.	一个 BLM 抗议者的雕塑竖立在科尔斯顿之前占据的空基座上。

Wendy Rogers Calls New Zealand PM 'Lenin With Hair,' Claims 'Satanic Communists' in U.S.	Wendy Rogers 称新西兰总理为“留着头发的列宁”，并称美国为“邪恶共产党”

In the clip, Ardern was speaking about COVID misinformation and New Zealand's efforts to keep people informed about the pandemic.	在短片中，Ardern 谈到了新冠病毒的错误信息以及新西兰为了让人们了解疫情而做出的努力。
"More bold Christians are needed in office to counter the satanic Communists in both parties," the Arizona Senator wrote in another tweet on Sunday.	这位亚利桑那州参议员周日在另一条推文中写道：“执政期间需要更多勇敢的基督徒来对抗两党中的邪恶共产党。”
Her Tweet was met with ridicule from different social media users, with one person tweeting back: "Please offer your definitions of Communism and Christianity, because I don't think you understand either."	她的推文遭到了不同社交媒体用户的嘲笑，其中一个人回复道：“请提供您对共产主义和基督教的定义，因为我认为您也不理解。”
"I see that Wendy is going all out today, trying to compete with the craziest of the crazy," another person tweeted.	“我看到 Wendy 今天全力以赴，试图与最疯狂的疯子竞争，”另一人发推文说。

Writer Shiv Ramdas also denounced the tweet by paraphrasing her own words: "'working is Communism.'"	作家 Shiv Ramdas 还通过解释她自己的话来谴责这条推文：“‘工作就是共产主义’。”
Separately, Rogers has frequently suggested that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election and called for a new election.	另外，罗杰斯经常暗示唐纳德特朗普赢得了 2020 年总统大选并呼吁举行新的选举。
"I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be conducted.	“我呼吁将拜登的选民召回亚利桑那州，并且必须举行新的选举。
Arizona's electors must not be awarded fraudulently..." the senator tweeted in July.	不得以欺诈方式让亚利桑那州的选民选举...”这位参议员在 7 月发推文说。

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80	《夜访吸血鬼》作者 Anne Rice 去世，享年 80 岁
She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said.	Christopher Rice 说，Anne 死于中风并发症。
Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.	Rice 最大的成功是她的第一部小说《夜访吸血鬼》，这部小说于 1976 年出版，介绍了吸血鬼 Lestat 的角色，Rice 将成为 13 本书编年史系列的中心人物，最近的一本于 2018 年出版。
"I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010.	Rice 2010 年在南伊利诺伊大学的一次演讲中说：“我认为 Lestat 是行动者，可以做到超出我能力范围的事情。”
"Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series.	《夜访吸血鬼》于 1994 年成功拍成故事片，有助于重新点燃对吸血鬼类型的兴趣，并在电视剧《吸血鬼日记》和《暮光之城》系列电影中延续。
Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography.	根据 Rice 的网站传记，尽管她大部分时间都住在加利福尼亚州，但 Rice 是新奥尔良人，她的许多故事都是在新奥尔良创作的。
Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died.	Rice 的儿子 Christopher Rice 说，当她母亲去世时，他就在她的床边。
Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.	他说，Anne Rice 将在新奥尔良举行私人仪式，并计划明年举行公开纪念活动。
Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size	Apple Music 文档和数据存储大小

I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone.	我已经尝试通过删除应用程序来解决此问题，但由于这是一种库存应用程序，文档和数据永远不会真正从 iPhone 中删除。

After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data.	从 iCloud 备份安装后，我检查 Apple Music 应用程序，它仍在使用超过 30GB 的文件和数据。
After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do.	在联系了两位 Apple 支持专家后，一位建议我擦除我的 iPhone 并从头开始，而另一位则没有提供任何真正的建议，因为问题超出了他的能力范围。

This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring	今年的趋势是在卧室里再放一棵圣诞树，这使小云杉的销量飙升
Got just the one Christmas tree?	只有一棵圣诞树？
Then you could be behind the times.	那么您可能落伍了。
This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring.	今年的趋势是在卧室里再放一棵圣诞树，这使小云杉的销量飙升。
More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol.	专家说，超过四分之一的英国家庭现在拥有两棵节日冷杉 - 这可能远不只是身份的象征。
Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia.	据说，舒缓的绿色和杉树的香气对心理健康和睡眠周期都有好处 - 即使是假树也有助于唤起一种怀旧的感觉。
Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours.	其他家庭有两棵树，这样，孩子们可以在一棵树上随意装饰，展现任何家庭自制杰作，同时在更显眼的展示处留下更雅致的花环，给邻居留下深刻印象。
Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire.	剑桥公爵夫人的母亲 Carole Middleton 也是美国跟随这一趋势的人，她在西伯克郡巴克伯里的家中为孙子 George、Louis 和 Charlotte 又买了一棵树。
Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself."	上周，她在 Instagram 上发帖：“今年我们还打算买两棵圣诞树：一棵供孩子们装饰，一棵我自己装饰。”
British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites.	英国花园中心协会表示，今年在其 58 个销售点中，小树的销量增长了 50%。
Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees."	Boyd Douglas-Davies 主任，也是园艺行业协会主席，他说：“人们正在流行购买卧室植物，在卧室中放置装饰精美的树木。”
Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more.	Fellow 花园中心连锁店的 Squire 报告称，他们 30% 的客户计划至少拥有两棵树 - 超过十分之一的人打算拥有三棵或更多。
Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep."	主席 Sarah Squire 说：“它们给卧室带来一种宜人平静的气味，是良好睡眠的完美帮手。”
Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber.	众所周知，卧室植物有助于心理健康和净化空气，据说树木也有助于睡眠。
Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response.	睡眠专家 Carl Walsh 说：“我们的大脑从周围环境收集信息，然后将其转化为释放激素的信号作为回应。
In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state."	在这种情况下，褪黑激素和皮质醇是控制睡眠周期并使身体进入困倦状态的激素。”
He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era.	他补充说，卧室中的树也可以将人们带回一个更加无忧无虑和朝气蓬勃时代。
"Christmas can be a pretty stressful time.	“圣诞节期间，人们的压力可能很大。

Makeshift Munster crush Wasps in Champions Cup cracker	临时芒斯特队在冠军杯对决赛中碾压黄蜂队
Munster overran Wasps in a thrillingly chaotic Heineken Champions Cup clash contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid and injury problems.	芒斯特队在喜力冠军杯比赛中击败了黄蜂队，这场比赛一片混乱，临时组建的球队受冠状疫情和伤病所困扰。
A rollercoaster first half ended with Munster leading 13-7 after Wasps skipper Brad Shields had been controversially sent off for a dangerous tackle on Dave Kilcoyne.	过山车般的上半场结束，蒙斯特以 13-7 领先，黄蜂队队长 Brad Shields 因对 Dave Kilcoyne 的危险铲球被罚下。
And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 men were on the ropes and Munster reacted by engineering tries for debutant Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway.	在半场结束时，胡克选手 Dan Frost被禁赛，他们的 13 名队员陷入困境，芒斯特对首次亮相的 Patrick Campbell 和 Andrew Conway 的密谋企图做出了回应。
Alfie Barbeary's all-action display capped by a captivating try had given Wasps hope but he was unexpectedly replaced at half-time and it became one-way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class to finish in the 43rd minute.	Alfie Barbeary 的全动作表演以一次迷人的尝试而告终，这给了黄蜂队希望，但他在中场休息时出人意料地被换下，从 Campbell 在第 43 分钟带领整个球队完成比赛的那一刻起，比赛就变成了单向控球。
Missing 17 players to injury, Wasps also had to contend with the loss of four more to Covid in the morning, resulting in a hasty reconfiguration of the team.	黄蜂队因 17 名球员受伤而缺席比赛，上午又有 4 名球员因感染冠状病毒而被带走，这导致球队仓促重组。
Munster, meanwhile, were missing 34 squad personnel because of quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, creating five debutants in the starting XV and another seven on the bench.	与此同时，芒斯特在最近前往南非的倒霉的联合橄榄球锦标赛之旅后，因隔离而失去了 34 名队员，在首发 XV 中布置了 5 名新人，在替补席上布置了另外 7 名新人。
Crucially, however, Ireland stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls were present to stiffen their ranks.	然而，至关重要的是，爱尔兰明星如 Tadhg Beirne、Peter O'Mahony、Conor Murray 和 Keith Earls 出席了比赛，以加强他们的实力。
For all the absentees, it was an enjoyable spectacle where it appeared at times anything could happen, at least until Munster showed the extraordinary depth of their playing resources to pull clear.	对于所有缺席的人来说，这是一个令人愉快的场面，有时似乎任何事情都可能发生，至少在芒斯特展示了他们非凡的比赛资源之前是如此。
Wasps' Covid-affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'Mahony's excellent covering tackle.	当比赛开始时，黄蜂队因受新冠病毒影响而导致开局更加复杂，Thomas Young 拒绝了 O'Mahony 出色的盖帽铲球。
And while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening.	虽然 Joey Carbery 在立柱之间送出一个点球，为芒斯特首先进攻，但 Jimmy Gopperth 击中了横梁，延续了两届冠军赛的不幸开局。
But their scrum was offering a foothold in the game and it took feverish defence to keep their maul at bay until they produced the first of two turnovers in quick succession.	但他们的并列争球在比赛中提供了一个立足点，在他们快速连续两次失误中的第一次失误之前，他们一直防守防守，以阻止对方的进攻。
Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees and their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck.	芒斯特不顾人员缺席，为每一个球而战，当 Shields 被出示可疑的红牌时，他们的胜利前景得到了极大的提升，裁判 Romain Poite 说他的肩膀卡住了 Kilcoyne 的脖子。
Carbery directed a simple penalty at the post and while he was on target soon after, a dramatic twist followed as Wasps plundered a stunning try through Barbeary.	Carbery 在门柱上罚了一个简单的点球，当他很快射中目标时，一个戏剧性的转折发生了，黄蜂通过 Barbeary 抢夺了一个惊人的机会。
It concluded an exhilarating spell of end-to-end rugby in which the rivals took it in turns to attack from deep and, having been at the heart of the home advances, Barbeary delivered the telling blow.	它结束了一段令人兴奋的端对端橄榄球比赛，对手们轮流从深部进攻，而 Barbeary 一直是主场进攻的核心，因此受到了明显的打击。
A kind bounce off Murray's kick presented Earls with the simplest of tries as Munster hit back and then Frost departed for the sin-bin as the home side were reduced to 13.	Murray 的一脚射门给 Earls 带来了最简单的尝试，Munster 回击，Frost 随后被罚下场，主队减少到 13 人。
It did not take long for the advantage in personnel to be felt as Beirne started a breakout try that ended with full-back Campbell producing a brilliant finish.	没过多久，Beirne 就开始了突破性的尝试，并在边后卫 Campbell 的精彩射门中取得了突破，在人员上的优势开始显现。
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.	芒斯特在第 49 分钟消失在视线之外，Conway 在一次有希望的反击中轻松传球，完成了一次简单的磨合。
Hooker Scott Buckley, man of the match on his Munster debut, was the next over from a lineout move and that was the game won, although Michael Le Bourgeois picked a quality line to improve Wasps' final score.	Hooker Scott Buckley 是芒斯特处子秀中的最佳球员，他排在第二位，这就是比赛的胜利，尽管 Michael Le Bourgeo 选择了一条高质量的路线来提高黄蜂队的最终得分。
France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece	法国回应美国向希腊提供护卫舰的竞争产品
The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates.	法国和希腊国防部均已确认，美国的竞争性报价不会影响已经“签署”和“最终”的数十亿美元购买法国 Belharra 护卫舰的协议。
France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates.	法国武装部周六表示，在美国国务院宣布批准出售美国护卫舰之前，与雅典的国防合同已经在“几天前”草签。
Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table...	由于我们一直在与希腊人讨论，美国的提议不再摆在桌面上...
We also signed the contract with the Greeks.	我们还与希腊人签订了合同。
Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis.	希腊国防部还证实，与巴黎的协议是“最终协议”，因为该协议是在“可能的最高级别”进行谈判的，并由希腊总理基里亚科斯·米索塔基斯“亲自宣布”。
The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon."	据称，最终确定的合同预计将“很快”得到希腊议会的批准。
The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates.	美国国防安全合作署周五表示，它已批准以 69 亿美元的价格出售四艘 Lockheed Martin 战斗护卫舰，以及另外一项价值 25 亿美元的升级希腊 MEKO 级护卫舰的计划。
The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning.	这一声明引发了对《雅典-巴黎协议》的一些担忧，特别是在未事先警告的情况下，法国和澳大利亚之间长期存在的潜艇建造“世纪协议”于 9 月突然被一项轰动的奥库斯协议摧毁之后。
Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty."	愤怒的巴黎指责华盛顿和堪培拉“在背后捅刀子”，而仅仅两周后，马克龙与希腊总理上台，亲自宣布以约 35 亿美元的价格向雅典出售至少三艘法国军舰，称现在是时候“不要再天真了”，同时将新政吹捧为“欧洲战略自主权和主权”的标志。
This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.	这一次，根据法国军方的说法，美国“已经警告我们这一声明即将发布”，并且据称美国人“无意进一步”实际出售他们的护卫舰。
