是否有途径处罚他	Is there a way to punish him?
以免再次发生这样的事情	So that such a thing won’t happen again.

浙大学术年会上学生唱主角 研究成果让人脑洞大开-新华网	Students played the leading role at the Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University with creative research achievements - Xinhuanet
用空气来洗手，哈口气判断疾病，精确搜寻雾霾来源 昨天晚上，在浙江大学2016年学术年会开幕式上，一系列脑洞大开的学术成果获得表彰。	Washing hands with air, diagnosing disease through breath, and accurately seeking for source of smog; last night, a series of creative academic achievements were awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
这些成果的主要研究者都是学生，研究覆盖了环境、机械、能源、医疗、生命科学、人文教育等各大领域，同学们从一个好奇的点子开始，创造出了许多具有应用价值的高端发明，其中一些项目已在国内国际获奖。	The main researchers of these achievements are students, with research covering major fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education; students created many high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have won awards at home and abroad.
生物传感器：你的家庭体检医生	Biosensor: your home physical examination doctor
生物医学工程学院博士生张迪鸣团队现场展示了一个智能手机端的生物传感器，大小只有智能手机的一半。	The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone with the size of only a half of a smart phone.
“你只需要轻轻呼一口气，这套仪器就能从你呼出的气体成分中，初步检测身体健康状况 。 ”	“All you need to do is to breathe out, and this set of instrument can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the components of the air you breathe out.”
张迪鸣介绍说，这套传感器与智能手机相连，呼出气体后，健康报告就会显示在手机上。	Zhang Diming introduced, this set of sensor is connected to the smart phone; after you breathe out, the health report will be shown on your phone.
市场上能够检测健康状况的智能手环，一般检测的是温度、脉搏等物理参数。	Smart bands on the market which can detect health conditions often measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
而这套生物传感器运用了石墨烯这种新型材料，它的目标物是化学元素，敏锐的“嗅觉”让它能更深度、准确地体现身体健康状况。	This set of biological sensor uses the new material of graphene; its target is chemical elements, and its keen “sense of smell” enables it to reflect the health status of the body more in-depth and accurately.
智能手术灯：医生的高能眼睛	Smart operation lamp: high-functioning eyes for doctors
除了智能手机，手术室里也用起了智能手术灯。	In addition to smart phones, smart operation lamps are now being used in operating rooms.
这项发明在今年第44届瑞士日内瓦国际发明展中获得银奖。	This invention has won the silver prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
光电科学与工程学院硕士生朱林靖、申俊飞团队在传统手术灯的缺陷中开启了新思路，发明了智能LED手术无影灯。	The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two graduate students from School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, developed a new idea trying to solve the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented the smart LED operation shadow-less lamp.
“很多疾病早期检测、切除不到位，跟医生手术室用的灯有关 。 ”	“Improper early detection of many diseases and inaccurate excision are related to operation lamps used by doctors.”
申俊飞说，比如癌症早期检查时，医生如果不能及时看清所有肿瘤组织，那么之后癌细胞还会扩散。	According to Shen Junfei, for example, in early inspection of cancer, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues in a timely manner, the tumor cells will still spread.
这种智能手术灯有四个灯盘，通过调节光谱，来增强不同组织在光照下的区别度。	This type of smart operation lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum.
在手术过程中，医生可以根据手术需要和个人习惯，随时调节光斑的大小、光亮程度、光谱、颜色均匀性以及无影率。	During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformness and shadow-less degree any time according to demands of operation and personal habits.
这种智能手术灯已经在浙江大学医学院附属邵逸夫医院、浙江大学医学院附属儿童医院等医院试用，得到较好的反馈。	This type of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Shaw Hospital Afflicted to Zhejiang University Medical College and the Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, and received favorable feedback.
去年十月，这项发明获得国家挑战杯一等奖。	Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup Competition.
用空气洗手：省水又酷炫	Washing hands with air: save water in a cool way
普通人洗手就是用水冲，顶多擦点肥皂，挤点洗手液，而李启章等同学则发明了一套“空气洗手装置 ” 。	Normally, people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap and sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of “equipment to wash hands with air”.
只要站上装置的洗手台，我们的体重就能将空气压缩而出。	As long as we stand on the washbasin of the equipment, our weight can compress the air out.
“就像是一个打气筒。	“Just like an inflator.
压缩出的空气，在水龙头处形成流体，和水结合在一起。	The air compressed out can form a flow at the faucet and combine with water.
这样，我们就能把手洗干净啦 ！ ”	As such, we can wash our hands clean!”
显色反应和细菌残留实验证明：通过这种方法洗手的效果，和普通的洗手方法是一样的。	Chromogenic reaction and germ residue experiment results prove that the effect of hand washing this way is the same as that of the ordinary method.
这个装置只需要依靠我们自身的重力作为驱动，既能保证洗净程度，又能节约90%的水，整个过程完全无能耗，节能环保。	This equipment is only driven by our weight, which can not only guarantee we wash our hands clean, but also save 90% of water; the entire process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environment-friendly.
去年，在第二届全球重大挑战峰会中，这项发明在诸多世界顶尖名校中脱颖而出，获得唯一的金奖。	Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention emerged among all the top universities in the world and was awarded with the only gold award.

觉得很有意义的一本证书——急救证	A certificate I deem meaningful, Certificate of First Aid
这是我除了驾驶证之外一本觉得重要的技能证书之一！	I think this is one of the most important skill type certificate except for driving license!
普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。	For your information: first aid measures refer to emergency rescue in emergencies, i.e., emergency treatment conducted before the coming of the ambulance.
众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。	As everyone knows, there is a period before the coming of the ambulance after the accident happens, which is most critical.
这个时候便是需要急救的时候。	This period is the most important time for first aid.
如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！	If we suffer from heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage or respiratory arrest, our life window is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！	So it is very important for those around us to know first aid!
当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。	When somebody falls down, we can conduct first aid with our professional knowledge, instead of doing nothing and only standing there; this helpless feeling is really frightening.
“在中国，我们官方数据每年有三百万人意外死亡，最危险的叫心脏骤停。	“In China, 3 million people die from accidents every year according to official data, and the most dangerous one is known as cardiac arrest.
在美国全国是平均15%能救过来。	15% of people of cardiac arrest can be brought back to life in the United States.
在拉斯维加斯的赌场酒店，百分之七八十能救过来，上海、北京低于1%。”	In the Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, 70% or 80% of them can be brought back to life, and the proportion in Shanghai and Beijing is lower than 1%. ”
这是第一反应创始人陆乐说的。	Said Lu Le, the founder of the First Reaction.
如果一个人发生了心脏骤停，呼吸没有了，心跳没有了，你掐人中是没有任何作用的。	Pinching philtrum has no effect at all if a person suffers from cardiac arrest and there is no sign of breathing or heartbeat.
必须做人工呼吸、胸外按压才有可能把人救过来。	Artificial respiration and external chest compression are required to bring them back to life.
我发现我们现在还很少人会有这种意识去学习急救，但是当事情发生的时候就来不及了，所以还是呼吁大家都去学习一下这个技能，让我们在面对突发状况的时候能够及时作出反应。	I found that very few people have the awareness to study first aid knowledge, but it will be too late once accident happens; therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond timely when faced with emergency situations.
说不定还能挽救一个人的生命！	We may bring somebody back to life with this skill!
急救证可以在你们当地的红十字会培训中心报名，我是在珠海的红十字会培训中心报名的，学生还有优惠呢。	People can apply for the certificate of first aid at your local Red Cross Training Center, and I applied for my certificate at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai; students are offered with a discount.
PS：最后一张图是记录自己25岁前要完成的目标的，把急救证加入目标清单也是几个月前的事情，但是确实是完成了呀！	PS: The last picture is the goals I aim to achieve before 25 years old; I added the Certificate of First Aid a couple months ago, but I did achieve it!
接着要去考其他想考的证书了，打算去考个潜水证，之前在小红书看到还有个潜水急救证，考这个证好像还得有急救证才可以去考，所以其实急救证还是很有用的！	Next, I will apply for other certificates; I plan to get Diving Certificate; I saw on Red earlier that there is a Diving First Aid Certificate, which requires a Certificate of First Aid first, so getting a Certificate of First Aid is useful!
我 order 了 ＃#NUMBER#	I ordered ＃#NUMBER#.
其中 13 元的虾饺就一个！？	There is only one 13-yuan shrimp dumpling! ?
没试过	I haven’t tried it before.
怎么 #NAME# 不写明白？	How can you not write your #NAME# clearly?
一个要 13 元？	Is it 13 yuan for only one?
昨天 #PRS_ORG# 漏送餐品，这次就一个虾饺给我吃！？	Yesterday  #PRS_ORG# missed some food in the delivery, and now I only have one shrimp dumping! ?
因为明明我之前输入 code 时看到是有效的	Because I clearly saw the code was valid when I entered it.
先说结论，我个人认为《四海》是一部全方位的烂片，从各种意义上来说都是。	I will say my conclusion first; I think Only Fools Rush In is utterly a terrible film in any sense.
但你要说这部电影是不是一个亮点也没有，那倒也不是至少配乐选的挺好。	But it is not without any highlight; at least the music is good.
烂片分很多种，让你能在电影院里酣然入睡的算一种，让你看完后义愤填膺的也算一种，《四海》对观众来说就像是峨眉山上的猴子，它能用无数种方式来点燃你的怒火。	There are many types of terrible films; some make you sleep soundly in the cinema, some make you angry after watching it; Only Fools Rush In is like monkeys on Mount Emei; it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
在侮辱观众这点上，韩寒真的是天赋绝伦。	Han Han is super talented in insulting the audience.
这部片子最让人感到痛苦的就是它仿佛是克系小说里的造物，难以名状，漏洞多的就像是小马哥身上的风衣。	The most painful part of the film is that it is hard to describe like a monster in Cthulhu novels, and has as many loopholes as the holes on the trench coat on Javier Mascherano.
甚至看完后你会怀疑这里面是否有导演暗含的隐喻，但当你仔细思考之后发现它其实就是一坨屎。	After watching it, you may even wonder if there is metaphors the director planted in it; but you will find that it is only a piece of shit after close examination.
先简单的说下我很难理解的一些情节。	I’ll first briefly talk about some plots that are hard to understand.
男主居住地应该是偏南方的某个小岛上，和他的奶奶相依为命。	The male leading role lives with his grandma on some island in the south.
她奶奶有个愿望是想看下雪，然后剧情就安排邻里中的一个大爷开着小面包车送她去东北看雪。	His grandma has a wish, watching the snow, and the a old male neighbor drove a minibus to take her to watch the snow in the Northeast.
高龄老人坐着面包车从南方到东北看雪？？	An elderly goes to watch the snow in the northeast from the south in a minibus? ?
他和他爹对此还非常放心。	He and his father were okay with it.
然后这位老人就没下文了。	And then there is no follow-up on this old lady.
在废弃轮船上开酒店，女主他哥怎么拿到营业执照的？	Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship; how does the brother of the female leading role get the license?
岛上飞车党小混混为什么能轻轻松松就把一段山路做到封路？？	How do the racing bike gang on the island easily block a mountain road? ?
然后路中间送钢筋的卡车就停在路边，四周连卡车司机都找不到。	Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road just stopped at the roadside, and the truck driver was nowhere to be found.
这道具感也太明显了吧。	They are obviously props.
一个征信不行的且有违法嫌疑的小混混飞车党为什么会成为一名辅警？	Why could a little gangster biker with poor credit and who was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary policeman?
面对高利贷为啥不报警，电影里警察还特地问了是否有难处？	Why didn’t he call the police when there was usury involved, and the police specifically asked if there was any problem.
一个成年人懂得用智能手机，却不知道在旅馆如何用房卡开门，然后强行安排找不到旅馆老板，坐在房间门外睡一宿？	An adult who knows how to use smart phone doesn’t know how to use the card to open the door at the hotel, and it was forcefully arranged for him not being able to find the owner of the hotel and so he slept outside the hotel for the night?
这种莫名其妙的情节充斥在整个影片里，由于情节过于离谱以至于我回忆它们时都会令我感到痛苦。	Such ridiculous plots were everywhere in the film; the plots are so ridiculous that I feel painful when I remember them.
除了情节外，更糟糕的是电影的主旨，或者说这电影根本没有主旨，就是一个面目可憎的缝合怪。	In addition to the plots, the theme of the film is even more terrible, or you can say there is no theme in the film; it’s just a horrible monster that is stitched together.
影片开头你会以为他想拍个喜剧片，20多分钟后你猜它也许是个励志片，看一半时你觉得它可能是个想体现小镇青年生存不易的剧情片，看完后你就压根也不知道自己究竟看了个啥，随之而来的是对自己深深的怀疑，大过年的为什么要跑到电影院去欣赏大便。	In the beginning of the film, you may think he wants to make a comedy; after twenty minutes, you may guess it’s an inspiration film; after a half of it, you may think it’s a drama showcasing the hardship of a small town boy; after you watch all of it, you don’t even know what you have watched; what follows is deep doubt in yourself; why would you go to the cinema to watch a piece of shit during the Spring Festival?
对于大部分人来说其实也都非常熟悉各类电影的套路了，比如你要想拍摩托车手，那就励志＋喜剧然后告诉观众一个有天赋的菜鸟是如何一步步走向成功的。	Most people are familiar with the routines of various films; for example, if you want to make a film about a biker, then make it an inspiration + comedy to tell the audience how a talented rookie achieves success step by step.
如果你想拍爱情片，那你就老老实实讲喜欢骑摩托的小镇青年和服务员妹子之间的恩怨纠葛。	If you want to make a love film, just tell the story about a small town boy who loves to ride motorcycle and a girl who works as a waitress.
如果你想反映现实，那最起码你的情节不能出现和正常世界相悖的东西。	If you want to reflect reality, then the plot should not have anything that is contradictory to the normal world.
（比如尹正演的那个新摩托刚被烧了，然后还能唱歌的角色），就不能去开一些连肯尼迪看了都遭不住的脑洞。	(Such as the character played by Yin Zheng who sang after his new motorcycle was just burned ) please don’t think about ideas that are ridiculous.
至于女主明明不是弱智可在某些方面表现的就像个5岁小孩，我真不知道这是演技的原因还是导演的要求。	As for why the female leading role acts like a five-year-old child when she is not retarded at all, I really don’t know if there is problem with her acting or it was demanded by the director.
还有一点我也挺想不明白，韩寒作为一个赛车手为什么这么热衷于在他自己的电影里添加撞车情节？	And one more thing I don’t understand is why Han Han as a racer is so keen on adding the plot of car crash in his films?
这样的电影安排在春节档里，难道是为了给观众添堵吗？	Is such a film being arranged in the Spring Festival season to humiliate the audience?

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症	Doctors from South Africa: Although more transmissible, most of the patients infected by Omicron are mild cases
南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。	Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that patients infected by Omicron are milder cases compared with those infected by Delta, although Omicron is more transmissible.
据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。	According to report from the Associated Press, as Omicron is being transmitted in South Africa, a report by a physician organization composed by more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa says that most of the current patients of COVID-19 in treatment have mild symptoms, such as body ache and cough, which are similar to symptoms of flu.
该组织总监安本·皮莱（Unben Pillay）医生说，他每天都要看几十名病人，但是还没有任何病人需要住院。	According to Doctor Unben Pillay, chief supervisor of the organization, he needs to provide medical services to dozens of patients every day, but none of them needs to be hospitalized.
皮莱说 ： “ 他们能够在家里控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复 。 ”	Pillay said, “Their diseases can be controlled at home, and most of them can recover after quarantine of 10 to 14 days.”
他说，这包括老年患者和那些有健康问题的患者，这些人群本来更容易因冠状病毒感染而陷入重症。	He said that those included aged patients and patients with health problems, who were easier to become severe cases due to infection of the COVID-19.
他说，与之相比，在上一波的德尔塔疫情中，他治疗的新冠患者“呼吸困难，血氧水平低。	He said that, in comparison, the COVID-19 patients he treated in the last round of epidemic suffered from “breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen.
许多人几天内就要住院 ” 。	Many of them needed to be hospitalized within only a few days”.
在南部非洲首次报告奥密克戎变异毒株后的两周内，其他医生也分享了类似的经验。	Other doctors shared similar experience within 2 weeks after the first report of Omicron the new variant in South Africa.
虽然收集足够的数据还需要几个星期的时间，但医生的观察和早期证据提供了一些线索。	Although it will take some more weeks to collect sufficient evidence, observation and early proof from doctors have provided some clues.
据南非国家传染病研究所总结：在近几周住院的新冠患者中，只有30%是严重病症，是前一波疫情重症比例的一半；平均住院时间从8天缩短到2.8天；近期的新冠患者中，仅有3%死亡，而在南非早期爆发的病例中，死亡比例达20 % 。	According to the summary made by National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, among the patients of COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the last few weeks, only 30% of them were severe cases, which accounts for a half of the proportion of severe cases of the last round of epidemic; the average stay at hospital is reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the latest patients of COVID-19 died, which used to be as high as 20% in the cases of the early epidemic phase in South Africa.
非洲健康研究所所长威廉·哈内科姆（Willem Hanekom）引用国家传染病研究所的数据和其他报告说 ： “ 目前，几乎所有的迹象都表明，这是一种较温和的疾病 。 ”	By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, Director of Africa Institute of Health said, “At present, almost all the evidence indicates that this is a relatively mild disease.”
他还说 ： “ 现在还是早期，我们需要获得后期数据。	He also said: “However, it’s still at early stage, and we need to obtain data of later stage.
通常情况下，住院和死亡发生的时间较晚，而我们进入这一波疫情的时间只有两周 。 ”	In general situations, hospitalization and death happen later, and it’s only two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic.”
与此同时，世界各地的科学家正在观察病例数和住院率，同时测试目前的疫苗和治疗方法的效果。	At the same time, scientists from all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as testing the effect of the current vaccines and treatment method.
尽管德尔塔仍然是全世界主要的新冠病毒株，但奥密克戎病例正在数十个国家出现，其中南非为疫情中心。	Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 virus strain of the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries with South Africa at the center of the epidemic.
据卫生官员介绍，豪登省在12月的第一周发现的新病例增加了400 % ， 测试显示，奥密克戎变体的病例占90%以上。	According to introduction from health officials, the new cases detected in Gauteng province in the first week of December increased by 400%; according to test results, Omicron variant cases accounted for more than 90%.

教育时评:拯救被拐儿童要靠什么？	Education news commentary: What should we do to rescue abducted children?
如果类比“没有买卖就没有杀害”的著名公益广告语，那么，在没有“收拐”需求的良好环境里，群防群治、全民反拐，使拐卖行为无利可图、风险大、成本高，这类犯罪也就不会屡屡发生。	As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying”; in a good environment with no demand of “buying abducted children”, if the masses can prevent and fight against abduction together and make abduction an action with no benefit, high risk and cost, then such crimes will not happen again.
近日，公安部刑事侦查局打拐办开发的儿童失踪信息紧急发布平台上线。	Recently, the platform of emergency release of missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
这是为建立儿童失踪信息发布的权威渠道、及时找回被拐儿童而创设的互联网信息平台。	This is an Internet information platform established as an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and timely finding the abducted children.
听闻此App名为“团圆 ” ， 顿觉暖意十足。	I feel warm after hearing the App is named “reunion”.
新技术手段不仅名称“文艺 ” 、 情怀满满，而且信息化运用得当，实用、有效。	This new technical means not only has an “artistic” name and full of warm feelings, but also makes appropriate use of informatization, making itself practical and effective.
打拐执法，首要目标是寻回被拐的孩子，保护其人身安全、自由。	The first and foremost objective of fighting against abduction is to find the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom.
其次才是对嫌疑人的审判与惩罚。	The judgment and punishment to the suspect is secondary.
刑事惩罚的意义，从个别惩罚、社会预防到法律教育，可以列举很多“大词 ” 。	In terms of the significance of criminal punishment, lots of “big words” can be listed from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education.
但在拐卖案件告破之前，应优先关注被害人的人身安全。	However, before solving an abduction case, the safety of the victims should be priority.
事分轻重缓急，在急切的“寻救”目的之下，诸如“拐卖儿童是否应当一律死刑”之类众说纷纭、争议较大的话题，可以暂搁下来，谨慎讨论；但救助被拐儿童的事情等不得。	There are orders of priority; with the urgent goal of “rescue”, the discussion on contentious topics with divergent public opinions such as “if death penalty shall be applied to criminals of child abduction” can be shelved for now and be discussed with discretion; however, rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed.
根据此类案件的侦办经验，人贩子惯于在得手之后尽快远离作案地点。	According to the experience in solving such cases, human trafficking traders tend to run away from the crime scene as soon as possible after the crime.
寻拐行动多耽搁一分钟，孩子就可能更远离家长一步，案件侦破的难度也就增加一分。	Therefore, with each minute delayed in finding abducted children, the children are farther from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case also increases.
在此情况下，拿出如“团圆”平台这样直接有助于侦破案件、寻回孩子的有效办法，确实是务实的行动。	In this case, it is a practical action to present a platform such as “reunion” which can help solve the case and provide an effective method to find the children.
毕竟 ， “ 打拐”是需要运作起整个法制系统来做好的一件大任务。	After all, cracking down on abduction is a major task that requires the coordination of the entire legal system.
打击犯罪、保障儿童和家长权益，从立法的完善，到司法的保障，以及执法的缜密，无不需要贯彻“护幼扶弱”的关怀。	To crack down on crimes and protect the interests of children and parents, the care of “protecting the young and helping the weak” shall be implemented in the improvement of legislation, and in safeguarding judicial system and meticulous enforcement.
此外，拐卖儿童的预防，从家庭到社会，都还可以做得更好。	In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from the perspectives of both family and society.
比如一个常见的案例，一家三口在火车站休息，父母熟睡，醒来才发现孩子不见了。	Take a common case as an example; parents and a child were taking a rest at the train station, and the parents found their child missing after waking up.
不能期待一个两岁的孩子具有足够的自我保护技能，但作为年幼孩子的家长，应至少具有相当的保护意识。	You cannot expect a 2-year-old child to protect himself/herself; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least some degree of protection awareness.
父母两人轮流休息，又或将孩子置于稳妥的保护之下，都是预防儿童被拐的最起码手段。	The father and the mother can take turns in taking rest, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the basic approaches for protecting children from being abducted.
从警方打击拐卖犯罪的另一面看，购买被拐儿童一方也应被关注和惩治。	Viewing from the other side of the crackdown on abduction, the party purchasing the abducted children shall be given attention to and punished, too.
单个的不法行为，往往只是长长链条中的一环。	Any single illegal behavior is usually one link of a long chain.
根据我国《刑法》规定，拐卖儿童罪的法定刑起刑点为5年；情节特别严重的，可至死刑，并处没收财产。	According to the Penal Code in our country, the criminal penalty starting point of child abduction and sale is 5 years; suspects with especially serious circumstance may be sentenced to death penalty with confiscation of property.
起刑点高、最高刑重，在“轻刑化”的大趋势下，拐卖儿童罪显然属于处罚较重的罪。	Under the trend of “light sentencing”, the crime of abducting and selling children has a high starting point and heavy maximum standard of sentencing, and thus it is clearly a crime with heavier sentence.
可至今每年仍还有不少的拐卖案件发生。	However, there are still lots of cases of abduction every year.
可见，部分人在养育儿女方面的观念落后，法律意识淡薄。	It is clear that some people are still lagging behind in the concept of raising children and have dim legal awareness.
对这部分人的法制教育应该同步跟进。	Legal education should be provided to these people.
要有效控制拐卖犯罪，不能仅靠官方严格执法。	It requires not only strict enforcement from authorities to effectively control the crime of abduction and selling.
倘若收拐“市场”广泛存在，拐卖者利欲熏心，不断创新拐卖手段，形成与执法者的“斗法”局面，打拐行动势必会陷入低效的泥淖。	If the “market” of buying abducted children still exists, and abductors continuously create new ways to abduct children driven by the profits; this will lead to a situation where the criminals and law enforcers plot against each other, and the action to crack down on adduction will inevitably be low in efficiency.
因此，破除落后观念，普及法律常识，也有助于根治拐卖、收买儿童犯罪。	Therefore, correcting outdated concepts and popularizing legal common sense are also conducive to eradicating the crime of abducting, trafficking and buying children.

杨浩东从理想信念与初心使命、自我革命与青春大党、党的领袖和党的理论等三个方面，结合自身感悟、亲身经历，深入浅出、全面系统地阐释了全会精神的核心要义和实践要求。	In combination of his feelings and experiences, Yang Haodong interpreted the core essence and the requirement on practice of the spirit of the sixth plenary session of the 19th central committee in terms of three aspects, i.e., original aspiration and mission, self-revolution, as well as the young Party, leaders of Party and theory of the Party.
他指出，要将全会精神和习近平总书记对湖南重要讲话重要指示批示精神、省党代会精神结合起来学，融会贯通学，增强捍卫“两个确立 ” 、 做到“两个维护”的思想自觉、政治自觉、行动自觉，坚定不移沿着习近平总书记指引的方向前进。	As pointed by Yang Haodong, it is necessary to combine the spirit of the sixth plenary session of the 19th central committee and the spirit of the important instructions about Hunan by General Secretary Xi Jinping, and the spirit of the 12th Party congress of Hunan, to digest them and strengthen the guarding of the “two-establishment” and the ideological consciousness, political consciousness and action consciousness of the “two-guarding”, and to unwaveringly move forward in the direction pointed by General Secretary Xi Jinping.

其实，不知道是店铺出错，还是骑手出错	Actually, I don’t what went wrong, the restaurant or the delivery person.
袋子上没有单据	There is no receipt on the bag.
追查不了	It can’t be traced.
希望你们了解一下	I hope you can find out about it.
因为送货时间比显示快了 30 分钟	Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than what is displayed.
没有了，谢谢	Nothing else, thanks.
是的，已经换了一个骑手	Yes, the delivery person has been changed.

那家餐厅一直都说在处理中	The restaurant always said they were processing it.
等了几个小时	Waited for a few hours.
国际橄榄油协会将橄榄油分为初榨橄榄油（Virgin Olive Oil）和精炼橄榄油（Lampante Olive Oil或Refined Olive Oil）两大类，五个级别。	The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, and five levels.
初榨橄榄油或称为天然橄榄油，是直接从新鲜的橄榄果实中采取机械冷榨、经过过滤等处理除去异物后得到的油脂。	Virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is oil obtained from fresh olive fruit after removing foreign matters by mechanical cold pressing and filtering.
根据酸度的不同可分为三个级别：	There are three levels according to acidity:
特级初榨橄榄油（Extra Virgin）：是最高级别、质量最高的橄榄油，是纯天然产品。	Extra Virgin: is the highest level, best quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
口味绝佳，有淡雅怡人的植物芬芳，酸度不超过1%。	It has premium taste, a slight and pleasant plant fragrance and a acidity of less than 1%.
优质初榨橄榄油（Fine Virgin）：酸度稍高，但不超过2%，味道纯正、芳香。	Fine Virgin: has a slightly higher acidity of less than 2%, tastes pure and aromatic.
普通初榨橄榄油（Ordinary Virgin）：口味与风味尚可，酸度不超过3.3%。	Ordinary Virgin: taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
精炼橄榄油是指酸度超过3.3%的初榨橄榄油精炼后所得到的橄榄油，或成为“二次油”。	Refined Olive Oil refers to olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity of over 3.3%, also called as “secondary oil”.
精炼橄榄油可分为两个级别：	Refined Olive Oil can be divided into two categories:
普通橄榄油（Olive Oil）：精炼橄榄油与一定比例的初榨橄榄油混合，以调和味道与颜色，其酸度在1.5%以下，呈透明的淡金黄色。	Olive Oil: is refined olive oil mixed with virgin olive oil in a certain proportion to adjust the taste and color, has an acidity of under 1.5% and a transparent light gold color.
精炼橄榄杂质油或橄榄果渣油（Refined Olive-Pomace Oil）：是通过溶解法从油渣中提取并经过精炼而得到的橄榄油。	Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is olive oil obtained and refined from pomace with dissolution method.
看过等级分类的你应该已经发现，橄榄油的酸度是一个非常重要的指标。	After reading the classification, you may find the acidity of olive oil is an important index.
要知道，橄榄果就好像酿制葡萄酒的葡萄一样，来自不同的产区、不同橄榄果品种的橄榄果，就会出产不同标准的橄榄油。	You should know that olives are just like grapes that make wine, olives from different producing areas and different types of olives will produce olive oil of different standards.
油橄榄的最佳生长地：	The best growing area of olives:
地中海沿岸具有油橄榄生长所需的最适宜的土壤和气温、日照、空气湿度以及降水量等气候条件。	The Mediterranean coastal area has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity, precipitation and other weather conditions for olive growth.
除地中海沿岸外，其它地区只能在适生区零星种植。	Aside from the Mediterranean costal area, olives can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas in other areas.
主要产区产地（地中海）：	Main producing areas (the Mediterranean):
意大利、西班牙、希腊、土耳其、葡萄牙、摩洛哥、叙利亚、以色列、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、埃及、巴基斯坦、黎巴嫩等等，与其气候类似的也有远在南纬度的阿根廷、秘鲁、南非等等。	Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are far away in the southern latitude and have similar climate.
油橄榄的采摘月份：	Picking time of olives:
每年的3至6月，是油橄榄树开花坐果的时间，7至10月果实开始发育并且成熟，果实从绿色过渡到红色，紫色，最后变黑。	March to June each year is the time for olive trees to blossom and bear fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, and the color of fruit will transition from green to red, purple and finally black.
11月至次年2月是果实的采摘季节（橄榄油的新鲜度可是很重要的哦）。	November to February of next year is the picking time of fruit (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
橄榄油的营养成分：	Nutrients of olive oil:
橄榄油富含丰富的单不饱和脂肪酸，即油酸及亚油酸、亚麻酸，还有维生素A、维生素B、维生素D、维生素E、维生素K及抗氧化物等。	Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
橄榄油被认为是迄今所发现的油脂中最适合人体营养的油。	Olive oil is deemed the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils found so far.
民主峰会落幕，拜登称自由之火永不熄灭	The Summit for Democracy ended, and Biden said the fire of freedom would never extinguish
由美国总统拜登召集、有全球110个国家的政府以及公民社会和私营部门领导人出席的线上“民主峰会 ” ( Summit for Democracy)星期五（12月10日）落幕。	The online “Summit for Democracy” held by Biden, the U.S. president, and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and private sector from 110 countries came to a close on Friday (December 10).
拜登在闭幕词中说，自由之火在世界每个人的心中燃烧，专制政权永远无法将其熄灭。	Biden said in the closing speech that a dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.
他也表示，计划明年召开第二届全球“民主峰会 ” 。	He also said that the second global “Summit for Democracy” was scheduled to be held next year.
台湾政府代表、政务委员唐凤和目前流亡英国的香港民主人权活动人士罗冠聪也在第二天的峰会上发言。	Tang Feng, representative of Taiwan government and member of the administrative council, and Luo Guancong, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist who is currently in exile in the UK, made speeches at the summit on the second day.
拜登说 ： “ 我们知道摆在我们面前的工作是多么的艰巨。	Biden said, “We know that we are facing arduous tasks.
但我们也知道，我们可以迎接挑战，因为我以前说过，正如这次峰会所表明的，民主世界无处不在。	But we also know that we can meet the challenges, just as I mentioned before and as what this Summit stands for, the world of democracy is everywhere.
专制政权永远无法熄灭自由的微火，它在全世界和世界各地人们的心中燃烧 。 ”	A dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.”
拜登还表示，捍卫民主需要整个社会的共同努力。	Biden also said that joint efforts from the whole society were required to defend democracy.
他说 ： “ 作为政府的领导人，我们有责任倾听我们的公民，加固民主的护栏，推动改革，实现透明的问责治理，更能抵御专制的缓冲和冲击的力量，以及那些想在公共利益之前赤裸裸地追求权力的人 。 ”	He said, “as leaders of governments, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, realize transparent accountability governance, so as to be better equipped to resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship as well as people who bluntly pursue power in front of public benefits.”
“民主峰会”第二天的主题分别是捍卫人权，巩固民主与对抗威权，以及反击数字威权主义与肯定民主价值。	The themes on the second day of the “Summit for Democracy” were strengthening human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting against authoritarians, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the values of democracy.
这一天恰逢“国际人权日 ” 。	That day happened to be “International Human Rights Day”.
联合国秘书长古特雷斯在当天的开场讲话中也表示，民主事业在全球面临挑战，特别是新兴数字技术带来的挑战。	Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said in the opening speech on that day that the democracy was facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
他说 ： “ 现在是重申共同价值观和立场以及民主韧性的时候了。	He said, “It’s the time to reiterate the common values, standpoint, as well as the tenacity of democracy.
这需要深化社会对话，解决不平等问题，打击腐败，更新社会契约，为优质教育投资，并扩大妇女和女童的机会。	Social dialogue needs to be deepened to solve the problem of inequality, fight against corruption, update social contracts, invest in high-quality education, and provide more opportunities for women and girls.
这也需要坚决谴责一切形式的民粹主义、本土主义和极端主义，包括利用技术革命所提供的所有工具 。 ”	This also requires us to condemn populism, nativism and extremism of all forms, including making use of all the tools provided by technical revolutions.”
香港民主人权活动人士罗冠聪通过预先录制的视频对峰会发表讲话，提醒与会者持续关注香港和维吾尔族和藏族等中国少数民族的人权状况。	Luo Guancong, democracy and human rights activist from Hong Kong, gave a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, to remind conferees to continuously pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China including Uygur ethnic group and the Tibetans.
他说 ： “ 长期以来，世界一直接受中国的崛起，却没有建立一个机制来对其进行问责。	He said, “For a long time, the world has always accepted the rising of China; however, no mechanism has been established for accountability.
这就是为什么政治人物和民间社会领导人必须合作。	This is the reason why there must be cooperation between politicians and civil society leaders.
我们必须利用我们所拥有的一切（资源）来确保民主的复兴是我们的首要任务 。 ”	We have to ensure that we will use all (the resources) we have to make the renaissance of democracy our primary task.”
罗冠聪也呼吁自由世界团结起来对抗中共的威胁。	Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite together and fight against the threats from the Communist Party of China.
他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恼习近平总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。	He said, “Some of you may be afraid of offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize the threat (of the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values.
而这就是我们失败的原因。	And this is the reason why we failed.
这也是我们必须改变的原因 。 ”	This is also the reason why we must make changes.”
台湾行政院政务委员唐凤在出席“打击数字独裁主义，肯定民主价值”的圆桌讨论中，通过视频发布《国家声明 》 ， 强调台湾站在对抗专制和威权的最前线。	When attending the round table discussion on “Striking digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy”, Tang Feng, member of the administrative council of Taiwan, issued Country Declaration with a video to emphasize that Taiwan is on the forefront of fighting against dictatorship and authoritarianism.
他也分享了如何通过信息透明与构建互信来抗击新冠疫情的经验。	He also shared experience on how to fight against COVID-19 epidemic with transparent information and the construction of mutual trust.
他说 ： “ 在台湾的民主方兴未艾之际，我们始终坚定站在全球对抗威权主义的最前线，更在促进全球自由、民主和人权上，扮演领导角色。	He said, “As democracy in Taiwan is still making progress, we shall always stand on the forefront of fighting against the authoritarianism of the whole world, and shall play the leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
于疫情期间，各地的威权政府以公共卫生和集体利益为名，合理化侵犯人权的行为，全球民主呈现倒退的迹象。	During the epidemic, authoritarian governments from all over the world rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to retrogress in global democracy.
然而在台湾，我们不必封城就能控制疫情，不必下架就能战胜假信息 。 ”	However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without putting cities on lockdown, and we can defeat false information without removing it.”
就在“民主峰会”第二天日程进行的同时，美国财政部宣布对被认定严重侵犯人权的中国、朝鲜等几个国家的15名个人、10个实体依法实施制裁，同时对一家被认定利用监视技术协助侵犯人权的中国公司实施投资限制。	On the second day of the “Summit for Democracy”, Treasury Department of United States announced it would implement legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries including China and North Korea which were identified as having severely infringed on human rights; at the same time, it would implement investment restriction on a Chinese company which was identified as assisting in infringing on human rights by utilizing surveillance techniques.
已经拍照并上传给你们了	I have take a photo and submitted to you.
我知道呀。	I know that.
但餐厅不知道为什么不断推迟送货时间	But I don’t know why the restaurant kept putting off the delivery time.
原来要 #NUMBER#	It was originally #NUMBER#.
那总之我不叫了	Anyway, I won’t do it.
不吃了	I’m good now.
我一定会投诉	I will definitely make a complaint.
你送不到，怎么不早点讲啊	Why didn’t you say it earlier if you couldn’t deliver it?
等你那么久	I’ve waited so long for you.
没有，我没有收到 call	No, I didn’t receive the call.
请通知他再送到我们公司	Please notify him to send it to our company again.
我不想再等 #NUMBER# 分钟	I don’t want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
一个餐等了一个半小时	I’ve waited one and a half hours for one meal.
#PRS_ORG# 都未送到	#PRS_ORG# is not delivered.
我想取消订单	I want to cancel the order.
为什么不给取消	Why can’t I cancel it?
你好，餐厅送来的口水鸡是生的	Hi, the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce delivered from the restaurant is raw.
想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。	I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I couldn’t stick with it, so I thought I would just find one at a suitable price to practice with.
不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。	It was not friendly; in fact, the price is usually in proportional to the degree of friendliness; if you are not able to distinguish, then expensive ones usually are more friendly than cheaper ones, and the so called “entry-level” rackets are in fact industrial garbage.
它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。	They are low in strength, and there will be too much vibration when the ball hits on it; it cannot withstand hard balls, and even professional cannot handle it.
它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。	The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, we know you can’t learn to play it, and we know you're not willing to buy expensive ones, so we make a cheap one to fool you; you won't play it again after using it once or twice; since the racket is cheap, you don't feel it's a waste.
等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。	If you can tell the difference, it means you have made improvement; then you can come here to buy the expensive ones and I will make money twice.
建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？	I recommend you to spend the same amount of money on a better-quality second hand racket such as prince or DUNLOP; these two brands are not famous, and so even if they are good, they are not expensive; you can get a new one with 500 or 600 yuan and a second hand one with 200 yuan; isn’t it nice to have a thousand yuan racket with only so little money?
对新手挺友好，但一过了新手阶段就鸡肋了，但大部分人，特别是女生，过不了新手阶段。	It’s friendly to newbies, but once you passed that stage, it will become not so useful; but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newbie stage.
订单已多次延迟送货时间	The delivery time of the order has been put off multiple times.
请问可以帮忙跟进一下吗？	Could you help follow up on it?
推迟	Delayed.
谢谢	Thank you.
就是说，其实我已经有 credit 了？	That is to say, I actually already have credit?
接下来我需要重新下单吗？原来那一单不用理会了吗？	Do I need to re-place the order next? So I can just ignore the previous order, right?
你好，点了这家餐厅的食品，但送来的食品中缺少了很多，而且口水鸡也是生的	Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, and after I received the delivery I found a lot of things were missing and the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce was raw.
#PRS_ORG# 无缘无故说要我自取，麻烦请取消	#PRS_ORG# said I wanted to pick it up myself for no reason at all, please cancel it.
我下的单是要求送货，完全没有自取这回事	All my orders are delivery orders, and there has been no request of self pickup.

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。	Actually, there are many tricks for slightly overweight girls to match their clothes.
身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。	Slightly overweight girls shall wear skirts not too long or too short; they shall be of the length at around the knees, just covering the fat part of the thighs.
裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。	The fat thighs will be shown if the skirt is too short.
过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。	Skirts that are too long will make you look short and fat.
如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。	If you are dressed in three sections, upper, middle and lower, you will naturally look taller; that is, use different colors for upper body, skirt and stockings, and you will look taller and slimmer.
其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。	In fact, a lot of darker color clothes are what slightly overweight girls all have, which the author deeply agrees; dark colors are good methods to cover fatness of your bodies; in addition, noble and elegant black short shirts are best choices for slightly overweight girls.
穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。	You will look slimmer in dark clothes, especially black short skirts.
如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。	Wear stockings and low-key shoes if your calves are fat.
越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。	The more common the better; the color shouldn’t be too bright.
以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。	In case people will notice your legs and feet and think you’re fat.
对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。	Slightly overweight girls shall master the tricks for clothing matching.
微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。	Slightly overweight girls shall never wear close-fitting short skirts and the upper outer garment shall not be too short or tucked inside the skirt, which seem strange; slightly overweight girls with thicker legs shall wear black stockings or mesh stockings (thin meshes), a flare skirt with print pattern and soft texture, and a loose-collar upper outer garment to cover the defects of the body.
当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。	Of course, there are some skills for slightly overweight girls to wear short skirts.
胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。	When slightly overweight girls wear short skirts, they shall choose upper outer garment with the same color as the short skirt, so as to make them look taller.
短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔!	Wearing skirt with a pair of high heels will make your legs seem slimmer and longer, which is the most fashionable outfit in summer!
如果你是上身胖，但腿很瘦的MM，推荐选择华丽感的连衣短裙。	Girls with fat upper body and slim legs shall choose short dress of luxurious style.
不但能遮住大肚皮，更能展现你的优点。	It can not only cover the fat stomach, but also show your advantages.
A字短裙会很显瘦，比较适合胖女孩，上衣要选择紧身一些的，形成层次感会更显瘦。	A-line skirt makes people seem slimmer and is suitable for fat girls; it’s better to choose tight-fitting upper outer garment so as to form a sense of layers and make you look slimmer.
简简单单白T恤搭配短裙，胖MM也可以尝试。	Fat girls can also try simple white T-shirt with short skirt.
微胖的女孩也是能够穿出时尚感的。	Slightly overweight girls can be fashionable.
只要能够掌握好穿衣搭配的法则那么微胖的女孩子们也会是万众瞩目的焦点。	Slightly overweight girls can be the focus of attention as long as they master the clothing matching rules.
在穿衣搭配方面上有了改变后，在生活中也要多运动，争取早一天脱离微胖女生的标签吧😄	In addition to changes in matching outfits, slightly overweight girls need to do more exercises, and hopefully you will remove the label of slightly overweight girls sooner😄

女孩当箭靶为姐姐募捐 : " 想到是皮肉伤也就还好 " - 新华网	Girl raises donations for elder sister by acting a target, saying “It’s ok since they are only flesh wounds” - Xinhuanet
杭州武林广场一女孩站在一块大木板前头，木板上写有“人肉靶子，十元一箭”字样。	A girl stood in front of a big plank, which writes “human target, 10 yuan for each arrow” at Wulin Square in Hangzhou.
昨日上午，一则“杭州女孩甘当‘箭靶’为姐募捐”的照片刷爆朋友圈。	Yesterday morning, a picture of “a girl in Hangzhou raises donation for her elder sister by acting as a target” went viral all over WeChat.
照片显示，杭州武林广场一女孩站在一块比人略高的大木板前头，木板上写有“人肉靶子，十元一箭”字样，示意路人付款后可使用弓箭射击。	A picture shows a girl standing in front of a plank slightly higher than a person, which writes “human target, 10 yuan for each arrow” at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, indicating that people can shoot with a bow and arrows after making the payment.
该行为引发网友热议。	The behavior was discussed heatedly by people on the Internet.
昨晚，杭州市公安局下城分局宣传负责人向新京报记者证实，警方确认该女孩为姐姐募捐才做出这样的过激举动，但这种行为并不值得提倡，经告诫后，该女孩昨日已经离开当地派出所。	Yesterday night, the person in charge of publicity at Xiacheng sub-bureau of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the journalist of the Beijing News that it was confirmed by the police that the girl did this in order to raise donations for her elder sister; however, this behavior should not be advocated, and the girl left from the local police station yesterday after being warned.
女孩街头“箭靶”募捐被告诫	The girl who raised donations by acting as a target on the street was warned
网传图片中，一位长发女孩呈“个”字型站在一块大木板前，木板上用黑色墨水写有“人肉靶子，十元一箭”的字样，她身前另一块木板上写有其银行账号与微信、支付宝账号等。	In the picture appeared on the Internet, a girl with long hair was standing with her arms spread out in front of a big plank which writes human target, 10 yuan for each arrow” in black ink at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, and there was another plank in front of her which has the bank account, WeChat account and Alipay account on it.
该图片上网后引发争议。	The picture was discussed heatedly after it was posted on the Internet.
有网友认为，此举系“博眼球的乞讨行为 ” ， 也有不少网友对此表示同情。	According to some netizens, this behavior is “begging behavior which aims to grab attention”, but many others show sympathy to her.
“我们是23日上午10点左右巡逻到广场旁的时候发现的情况，当时围观群众已经不少了 。 ”	“We found her at about 10:00 am on the 23rd when we went on the patrol around the square, and there were already lots of onlookers.”
事发地附近的天水派出所民警接受当地媒体采访时称，摆摊的女孩子共有两名，均为20岁左右，打扮得青春靓丽。	According to what the police officer of the Tianshui Police Station near the site told the local media, there were two young and beautiful girls in early 20s who set up a stall.
其中，做“人肉靶子”的女孩一直在哭，求路人玩一下这个游戏；另一女孩在边上帮着吆喝，说自己这个朋友的姐姐得了白血病，现在急需手术费，请大家帮忙。	The girl acting as the “human target” kept crying, begging onlookers to play this game; the other girl was calling for attention on the side, saying that the elder sister of her friend suffered from leukemia and is in urgent need of operation fee, and asking onlookers to help her friend.

该负责人表示 ， “ 不提倡采取这种博眼球募捐方式 ” 。	According to the person in charge, “raising donations by grabbing attention is not advocated”.

2021年什么最火？	What is the hottest thing in 2021?
无疑是东京奥运会。	It was none other than the Tokyo Olympics.
您以为只有奥运健儿才能拿奖吗？	Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
前段时间有篇《快看！项目经理可冲击金牌的奥运项目》文章很火，里面提到项目经理们在很多项目上，绝对是可以一马当先，无人能匹： 搬砖、出差、熬夜是项目经理的日常，救火、背锅、道歉更是不在话下。	Recently, there is an article titled Look! An article titled Olympic Disciplines in Which Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals was viral, and it mentioned that project managers can be the foremost and unmatched in many disciplines, such as working arduously, going on business trips, and staying up late, the everyday work of project manager, and handling emergency, taking the blame and apologizing are nothing difficult at all.
看似玩笑调侃的一篇文章，却也道出了项目经理们的日常辛酸，背后代表的是对当前项目管理工作的力不从心。	A seemingly joking article also tells the bitterness of their daily work, and the hidden message is their insufficient energy to handle the current project management work.
而从事项目管理工作的人员，也渐渐选择通过一些行动来让自己摆脱工作中的困境。	People engaged in project management also gradually choose to get rid of the predicament in work by taking certain actions.
从每年攀升的PMP（国际认证的项目管理专业人士资格）报名人数来看，越来越多的项目管理从业人员通过学习来提升自己的项目管理能力。	Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants each year, increasing project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
据《中国项目管理二十年发展报告(1999-2019)》称：截止到2019年9月，全国累计PMP®报考人数近60万人次，通过PMP®认证人数约42万人，有效持证人数约30万人, 占全球PMP®持证总量的31.2%。	According to the 20-year Development Report on China’s Project Management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the national PMP ® applicants totals 600,000, with 420,000 passed the PMP ® certification, and the number of valid certificate holders are about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of certificates of PMP ® in the world.
近10年PMP持证人数逐年递增，这说明越来越多的项目管理者意识到：靠简单照搬以往“老经验”来做事已不可取，瞬息万变的工作环境让我们知道一个要学会，站在科学巨人的肩膀上去探索前行的道路。	In the past ten years, the number of people holding PMP certificates keeps increasing, which indicates that more and more project managers realize it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying “past experience”; the rapidly changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
然而，考了PMP就能保证项目管理工作畅通无阻了吗？	However, can you ensure the smooth proceeding of project management work after passing the PMP test?
很多项目管理初学者表示，通过学习PMP/IPMP等相关课程，可以系统性地掌握项目管理的十大领域和五大过程组等相关知识点，但真正进行项目管理工作的时候却还是一头雾水。	Many beginners of project management say that by learning courses of PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master knowledge points such as the ten fields and five major process groups of project management, but they are still confused when they are actually engaged in project management work.
很多项目经理常常反馈以下问题： 项目管理认知不到位，单纯依靠个人经验，空有项目管理理论，不知如何实践； 缺乏系统的项目管理流程制度支撑，工作中无法落地，项目预估不准，把控度灵敏度差，项目一拖再拖； 成员分工不明确、团队中的“老油条”不知如何应对 跨部门协助沟通不顺畅，项目难以推进 ……	Many project managers often reflect the following problems: project management awareness is not sufficient, relying solely on personal experience, and there is only project management theories and no ideas about how to practice them; lack of support of systematic project management process and system, unable to actually implement the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor sensitivity of control, and project being delayed again and again; the members’ division of labor is not clear, there’s no way to handle the “sophisticated ones” in the team, communication is not smooth between departments, and it is difficult to push the project forward...

《研发项目经理特训营》线上课程 这是一种线上碎片化学习的方式，结合了众多研发型企业的实战案例、工具和方法，帮助您掌握项目经理必备知识及标准动作，走上自身项目管理的进阶之路。	The online course R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many research and development type enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advancing journey of project management on your own.
这也是一次让企业用更低的成本和更少的投入，促进项目经理的培养进程，为企业带来高效运作结果的机会。	This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises with less cost and investment.

捷信“双十二”前夕向消费者倡导理性消费 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Home Credit advocated rational consumption to consumers before the “Double Twelve” sale - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
今年“双十一”狂欢节全国网络支付业务交易金额达到1.77万亿元，相较往年再创新高。	During the “Double Eleven” festival this year, the amount of national online payment business transaction reached 1.77 trillion yuan, creating a new high when compared with that of previous years.
花样繁多的满减红包，抓人眼球的直播带货再一次让消费者大呼获益，这股消费热潮一方面让人感叹国民消费力愈发强劲，另一方面也不得不冷静下来思考消费主义对社会以及当代主流消费群体的影响。	Various kinds of coupons and the eye-catching live-streaming sales once again make consumers feel they’ve gained benefits; this spending spree makes people feel amazed at the increasingly strong spending power of citizens; on the other hand, people need to calm down and think about the influences of consumerism on society and modern mainstream consumer groups.
在“双十二”到来前夕，捷信消费金融有限公司（以下简称“捷信 ” ） 发出理性消费倡导，提醒广大用户尤其是年轻人树立良好的消费意识与消费习惯，拒绝盲目消费与过度消费。	Before the “Double Twelve” sale, Home Credit B.V. (hereinafter referred to as “Home Credit”) advocated rational consumption, reminding its users, especially young users, to develop good consumption awareness and habits, and reject blind and excessive consumption.
据人民银行今年发布的《消费者金融素养调查分析报告》结果显示，全国消费者金融素养指数为66.81，与2019年相比，提高2.04。	According to the Report of Survey Analysis on Financial Literacy of Consumers published by People’s Bank of China this year, the financial literacy index of national consumers is 66.81, increased by 2.04 compared with that of 2019.
总体上，我国居民在金融消费层面上的表现较好，但在金融行为和技能的不同方面体现出较大的差异性，还需要进一步提升基础金融知识水平。	Generally speaking, citizens in our country have good performance on financial consumption; however, there are big differences in various aspects of financial behaviors and skills, and further improvement of popularization of basic financial knowledge shall be made.
老年人和青少年的金融素养水平相对较低 ， “ 一老一少”仍将是金融教育持续关注的重点对象；尼尔森发布的《中国年轻人负债状况报告》及央视财经发布的《2019-2020中国青年消费报告》显示，年轻一代具有巨大的消费潜力，信用消费成为消费升级重要途径，86.6%的年轻人都在使用信贷产品，近半数人没有债务累积，年轻一代虽然整体呈现理性消费趋势，虽与外界贴上的“过度挥霍”标签大相径庭，但部分年轻人的确存在过度消费、跟风消费行为，并因此产生了过大的财务压力和债务风险，甚至导致社会问题逐渐增加，金融企业应勇于承担社会责任，进行正向引导。	Level of financial literacy of senior citizens and young people is relatively low, and they will still be the key objects of financial education; according to the Report on Debt Status of Chinese Young People issued by Nelson and the Report of Consumption of Chinese Young People from 2019 to 2020 issued by CTV Finance, the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important means of consumption upgrading; 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt buildup; although there is a relatively rational consumption trend among the younger generation, which is drastically different from the label of “excessive squander” put on them by society, some young people indeed are involved in excessive consumption and consumption by following the trend, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even resulting in increasing social problems; financial enterprises shall shoulder their social responsibilities and guide young consumers in a positive way.
作为持牌消费金融机构，捷信一直致力于以优质、贴心的服务助力百姓构建自己的幸福生活，倡导消费者树立良好正确的消费观，并积极响应监管号召，以实际行动提升消费者尤其是年轻群体的理性消费意识。	As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has always been engaged in helping citizens construct their own happy lives with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating consumers to establish correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of the supervision units so as to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young consumers, with practical actions.
在过去多年间，捷信不断针对包含大学生在内的青年群体开展全方位、多样化的金融知识普及活动，并通过与国内顶级院校合作发动创新实践大赛等多种形式潜移默化对年轻群体的消费需求进行合理引导,帮助其树立理性消费观念,合理规划消费需求,进而为其累积人生财富助力。	In the past years, Home Credit has been holding comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities aiming at young people, including university students; in addition, it has unconsciously offered reasonable guidance on the consumption demands of young groups by means such as cooperating with top universities in the country to host innovative practice competitions, so as to help students establish rational consumption concept and plan for consumption demands reasonably, and to assist them in accumulating life fortunes.
双十二到来之际，捷信提醒所有消费者朋友树立合理的消费意识和正确的金钱观，抵制盲目消费和过度消费，规避消费借贷误区，以免影响个人征信以及今后的经济生活。	Upon the arriving of the “Double Twelve” sale, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish rational consumption awareness and correct concept of money, resist blind and excessive consumption, and avoid forming misunderstanding of loan for consumption, in case it will impact personal credit investigation and economic life in the future.

沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼的停留站包括阿曼、阿拉伯联合酋长国（阿联酋 ） 、 卡塔尔、巴林和科威特。	The locations where Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Arabia’s prince stayed include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
值得注意的是，这是自沙特阿拉伯及其阿拉伯盟友于 2017 年年中对卡塔尔实施禁运，导致海湾外交危机以来，穆罕默德王储首次访问卡塔尔。	It’s worth noting that it was the first time for Mohammed to visit Qatar since Saudi Arabia and the Arabian alliances imposed an embargo on Qatar in the middle of the year 2017 and led to the Gulf Diplomatic Crisis.
在这场危机中，沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋、巴林和埃及断绝了与卡塔尔的外交关系，并对其实施全面禁运，指责卡塔尔支持恐怖组织，同时与伊朗有着密切关系。	In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed the diplomatic relations with Qatar and implemented a full embargo; they blamed Qatar for supporting terrorist organizations and keeping close relations with Iran.
外交紧张严重影响了海合会的内部团结，对该地区国家的经济产生了负面影响。	Diplomatic tensions had a serious impact on the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, exerting a negative influence on economy of the countries and regions in that region.
四个阿拉伯国家封锁了通往卡塔尔的陆海空路线。	The four Arabian countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
这场危机仅在 2021 年 1 月的海湾合作委员会峰会上得到解决，各海湾国家签署了一项由美国和科威特调解迈向“团结与稳定”的协议。	The crisis was only solved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, 2021, when the gulf countries signed an agreement for “unity and stabilization” with the mediation by the U.S. and Kuwait.
沙特阿拉伯重新开放了与卡塔尔的边界。	Saudi Arabia has reopened its boundary with Qatar.
沙特阿拉伯和埃及正在通过两国在卡塔尔任命了新大使率先努力恢复与卡塔尔的关系。	Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in recovering the relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
海湾阿拉伯国家化解分歧，以恢复与卡塔尔的关系出自于为各国的利益和地区稳定而必须团结起来的要求，旨在应对共同挑战。	Arab countries in the gulf aimed to resolve divergence; and restoring relations with Qatar originates from the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, so as to cope with common challenges.
此次沙特王储访问阿曼期间，双方同意开通了两个海湾邻国间第一条直接陆路通道。	During the period when the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia visited Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land road passage between the two neighboring countries in the gulf.
连接两国长达725公里长的通道将为两国公民的出行和整合供应链提供便利条件。	A passage of 725km connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and integration of the supply chain of the two countries.
沙特阿拉伯公共投资基金 (PIF)将在阿曼投入50亿美元，两国企业签署了价值为300亿美元的13份合作谅解备忘录。	The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 5 billion USD in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding of cooperation worth 30 billion USD.
沙特王储对海湾国家访问之行恰逢伊朗与世界各大国就挽救名为《联合全面行动计划 》 （ JCPOA）的伊朗核协议 — — 一项海湾阿拉伯国家因认为无法解决与伊朗导弹问题而谴责的协议进行谈判。	The travel of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to gulf countries happened as the negotiation was ongoing between Iran and major countries about saving a nuclear deal named Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Arab Gulf countries as it’s believed it cannot solve the missile issue with Iran.
各海湾国家一直将伊朗视为长期的“竞争对手 ” ， 并将伊朗的核计划视为对地区安全的“威胁 ” 。	All gulf countries have always regarded Iran as the long-term “competitor” and regarded the nuclear program of Iran as a “threat” to regional security.
各海湾国家认为，不解决伊朗导弹问题，不采取行动来遏制伊朗在该地区的活动是有缺陷的。	According to the gulf countries, it is defective not to solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran or not to take actions to curb the activities of Iran in this region.
在各大国与伊朗核谈判未能满足各海湾国家愿望的背景下，沙特阿拉伯与伊朗进行了直接谈判。	Under the backdrop where the nuclear negotiation between major countries and Iran was not able to meet the demand of the gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation.
其目标是遏制该地区紧张局势的升级。	The objective was to restrain the upgrading of the tense situations in this region.
这是减缓海湾合作委员会国家经济增长的因素之一。	This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.

这是海湾合作委员会重新评估为促进恢复海合会统一作出贡献的外交成果的机会，同时提出各项措施，使其成员国充分合作，以应对共同挑战，为海湾国家的稳定与发展作出贡献。	This is the opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council; at the same time, various measures are being proposed to make the member countries cooperate sufficiently, so as to cope with common challenges and make contributions to stabilization and development of the gulf countries.

让大学精神与时代精神同频共振-新华网	Let university spirit resonate with spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
所谓大学精神，是指一所大学在发展过程中长期积淀形成的一系列办学理念和价值追求，是大学的灵魂所在。	University spirit refers to a series of educational philosophy and pursuit of values an university accumulates in its long-term development; it is the soul of the university.
从古至今，大学精神对于政治、经济、文化、科技、社会的发展，乃至一个民族的进步均至关重要。	Since ancient times, university spirit is indispensable in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology and society, as well as in the progress of a nation.
从世界第一所现代意义上的大学诞生起，大学就肩负起不同于其他社会组织的独特使命，对于我国大学来说，兴起于民族危难之秋，其精神更是深受传统文化和时代变迁的影响，倡导“明德济世，修齐治平”的价值理念和“兴学强国”的爱国主义担当。	Since the establishment of the first real university in the world, universities shoulder unique missions which are different from other social organizations; universities in our country emerged in times of national crisis; its spirit is heavily influenced by traditional culture and the change of times; it advocates the values of “benefiting the world with virtue, and governing the country with integrity” and the patriotic responsibility of “building a strong country by studying”.
当前，高等教育信息化、国际化趋势日益明显，全球范围的教育竞争、科技竞争、人才竞争不断加剧，高等教育事业作为重要的“供给侧 ” ， 其结构性改革正面临前所未有的机遇和挑战。	At present, with the increasingly prominent trend of informatization and globalization of higher education, competition of education, science and technology, and talent across the world are continuously fiercer; higher education is an important “supply end”, and the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
尤其是《统筹推进世界一流大学和一流学科建设总体方案》的提出，在展示了我国从高等教育大国向高等教育强国迈进的信心和决心的同时，更是对大学发展提出了更高更新的要求。	Especially, the issuing of the General Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of the Global Top Universities and the Top Disciplines showcases the confidence and determination of our country in the transformation from a giant of higher education to a strong country of higher education; at the same time, it also puts forward higher and newer demands on development of universities.
如何在较短时间内努力跻身世界一流行列，在仍有一定差距的基础上加快建成若干所世界一流大学和一批世界一流学科，实现“弯道超车 ” ？	How to ascend to the top in the world within a short time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines while there is still a gap, and “overtake on a bend”?
除了坚定目标自信、路径自信、能力自信，高校还应当充分发挥三种优势：一是后发优势，通过持续引进海外杰出学术人才，学习借鉴世界一流大学的先进经验，实现学术水平和办学质量的显著提升；二是文化优势，继承中华文明在五千年积淀的智慧内涵，弘扬发展优秀传统文化，以此来凝聚力量、塑造品牌、提升形象；三是制度优势，发挥社会主义国家的制度优越性，强化目标驱动，汇集共识合力，优化资源配置，为学校加速赶超世界先进水平提供可持续的坚实保障。	In addition to insisting on objective confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities and colleges shall also give full play to three advantages: the first one is the advantage of backwardness; through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, significantly improve the academic level and school running quality; the second one is the cultural advantage; inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization accumulated for five thousand years and carrying forward excellent traditional culture, unify strength, build brand and improve image; the third one is system advantage; give play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen objective driving, collect consensus and joining forces, optimize resource configuration, and provide sustainable and solid support for the university to speed up catching up with and surpassing the world advanced level.
特别要意识到，建设世界一流大学不可能千校一面，各个学校在发挥优势的同时，必须彰显个性和特色。	It shall be especially noted that in order to construct world-class universities, the universities shall manifest their uniqueness and their own characteristics at the same time of giving full play to its advantages.
办学特色既要有共性的中国特色，也要体现各自独特的目标定位、办学传统和资源禀赋。	Running an university has to possess the common Chinese characteristics and manifest unique objective positioning, school operation traditions and resource endowment.
就浙江大学而言，我们在办学中注重突出三个方面的特色：一是突出创新创业人才培养特色，构建科教融合、校企结合的整合育人环境，形成全链条的创业教育生态系统；二是突出学科交叉会聚特色，推动学科体系的优化调整，营造学科交叉的制度环境，积极培育交叉新兴学科和标志性交叉成果；三是突出办学体系和社会服务特色，开展深度国际交流合作，加快形成泛浙大产学研合作体系。	For Zhejiang University, three characteristics are emphasized in our operation: the first one is to highlight the special training of innovation and entrepreneurship talents: construct integrated teaching environment by combining science with education and combining schools and enterprises, and the full-chain entrepreneurship education ecological system; the second one is to highlight the feature of cross-discipline convergence: promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, build the environment of the cross-discipline system, and actively cultivate results of cross-discipline and emerging discipline research and landmark cross-discipline achievements; the third one is to highlight the school operation system and the social service features: carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate forming the industry-university research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
在这个过程中，尤为重要的是，要始终坚守大学精神，让大学精神与时代精神同频共振。	In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the university spirit, and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
对于浙江大学来说 ， “ 求是创新”校训 ， “ 勤学、修德、明辨、笃实”共同价值观以及“海纳江河、启真厚德、开物前民、树我邦国”共同构成了浙大精神的最新表述体系。	For Zhejiang University, the university motto of “seeking truth and making innovation”, the common values of “study diligently, cultivate morality, foster discernment, advocate honesty” and the principles of “harboring generosity like the ocean, seeking the truth while upholding morality, being brave enough to keep exploring, and building our country” constitute the newest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
这是学校坚持正确办学方向，不断积累文化高度、凝聚精神力量的重要保障，内涵丰富，意义深远。	The university insists on the correct direction of running an university, continuously accumulates the altitude of culture and the important support by condensing the power of spirit; it has profound connotations and far-reaching significance.
其中 ， “ 海纳江河”强调的是开放包容精神，体现以“天下英才为我所用”的胸怀，表现为汲取世界名校办学育人的优质理念 ； “ 启真厚德”强调的是求真至善精神，指的是大学在追求真理的同时，更当领受德行的陶冶和人格的砥砺 ； “ 开物前民”体现的是改革创新精神，既包含知识的求新，科研的创新，又表现为改革发展，革故鼎新 ； “ 树我邦国”强调的是爱国奉献精神，讲的是大学应当始终与民族命运同荣共辱。	In which, “harboring generosity like the ocean” emphasizes the spirit of inclusiveness, reflecting the mindset of “inviting all talents”, which is manifested as absorbing the premium concepts of university operation and talent training of world famous universities; “seeking the truth while upholding morality” lays emphasis on the spirit of the pursuit for truth and kindheartedness, meaning that universities shall accept the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality while pursuing for truth; “being brave enough to keep exploring” reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including innovation in knowledge and science and technology, as well as reform, development and innovation; “building our country”stresses the spirit of patriotism and dedication, meaning that universities shall always share the glory and disgrace with the destiny of the country.
这一系列精神理念和价值追求，正是浙江大学120年办学的灵魂所在。	These spiritual ethos and the pursuit of values are the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of university running.
“聪者听于无声，明者见于未形 ” 。	“Wise people can hear when there is only silence and see before things are formed.”
中国高校当进一步立足中国特色社会主义事业全局，深刻把握高等教育事业所处的时代方位和肩负的历史使命，加快建设成为世界一流大学。	Universities and colleges in China shall further master the direction of the times and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, and accelerate the construction of top universities in the world.
同时，坚守人文关怀和独立自由，让大学精神与时代精神、民族精神互相激荡，从而为实现国家富强和民族振兴，实现人类的共同理想提供不竭的动力。	At the same time, hold fast to humanistic care, independence and freedom, to make university spirit, spirit of the times and national spirit promote each other, so as to provide infinite power for realizing state prosperity, national rejuvenation and the common ideal of all human beings.

在NFT火速出圈之时，加密社区又冒出了一个新概念。	As NFT went viral beyond its own circle, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.

看到一则关于朋友股价的新闻，我最大的感触是企业在赛道的选择，也就是指投资标的行业的选择，首先要选择成长空间大的行业，至少1000亿以上的市场规模；其次，要选择未来增长性好的行业，考虑在未来3-5年后行业增长性达到最佳状态的行业；最后，要选择有政策扶持的行业。	I read a piece of news about one of my friends’ stock price, and my biggest feeling is the how the enterprise chooses its track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry; first of all, they should choose a industry with a large space for development and a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future and consider the industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose industries with policy support.
赛道有多宽指的是市场规模，赛道有多长指的是行业所处发展阶段，赛道是平坦还是崎岖指的是行业的竞争格局。	The width of the track refers to the scale of market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is easy or bumpy refers to the competitiveness landscape of the industry.

战略在于找方向，战术在于落地，在大多数战术思考之上，都有战略思考的空间。	Strategy lies in finding direction and tactics lies in implementation; above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
比如如何增加顾客数（战术思维）之上，可以思考是在当前领域持续深化还是横向领域延展（战略思维）；比如提升顾客留存率（战术思维）之上，可以思考如何提升核心顾客和高价值顾客的留存率（战略思维）；在提升活动参与度（战术思维）之上，可以考虑如何设置正确的活动KPI，达到正确的活动目标，比如提升目标顾客参与度、激活高价值沉默客、精准拉新；在提升DAU（战术思维）之上，可以考虑目前的增长是否健康可持续。	For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think about whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

从区块链技术发展角度来说，比特币并不是主角。	From the perspective of blockchain technology, bitcoin is not the leading role.
2021年11月14日比特币进行了一次名为“Taproot”的软分叉升级，该升级提高了比特币网络交易的匿名性，且通过改变区块本身的数据结构来减少交易中的数据负担。	On November 14, 2021, bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called Taproot, which improved the anonymity of bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网	Asian communities in the US complains about admission discrimination by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet
新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。	Message from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。	Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day.
该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。	According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.
许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。	According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process.
赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。	As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants.
美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。	Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。	Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts.
他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。	They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students.
目前，被投诉的３所高校尚未作出回应。	The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet.
亚裔教育联盟成立于２０１５年，当时曾投诉哈佛大学招生歧视，但美国教育部以程序理由未予受理。	Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
此次参与申诉的除美国华裔团体外，还包括美国印度裔、韩裔、日裔、巴基斯坦裔教育团体。	In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。	In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a plant located at Yuyao Zhangting Village in Zhejiang through an estate agent and decided to purchase it after seeing it on-site for a few times.
同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。	In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the house owner, about the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”	Lin signed as the payee on the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Plant, which stated that if the buyer does not to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double; both parties agree to sign the plant purchase and sale contract within one week. ”
然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。	However, both parties failed to reach an agreement on the main items in the contract including the scope of the sale of the plant and method of payment, and as a result, they were delaying the signing of the plant purchase and sale contract.
考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。	Considering they have not reached an agreement on the content of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 to Mr. Lu a few days later.
好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。	Mr. Lu was helpless and angry because he had a hard time finding the plant, paid the deposit, prepared the payment and was waiting for the contract to be signed, but the seller didn’t want to sell it anymore.
为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。	For this, Mr. Lu decided to sue Lin at the Yuyao People’s Court.
法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。	After the hearing, the court held that the two parties failing to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed; therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract and return twice the deposit.
一审判决后，原告提起上诉。	After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed again.
近日，二审法院维持原判。	Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.

（德国之声中文网 ） " 民主峰会"周五结束后，中国外交部发言人周六（12月11日）发表谈话表示，美国举办"领导人民主峰会 " ， 是"以意识形态划线，把民主工具化、武器化，假民主之名行反民主之实，煽动分裂对抗，转移国内矛盾 " 。	(Deutsche Welle Chinese Website) After the “Democracy Summit” on Friday, the spokesperson of Foreign Ministry of China delivered a speech on Saturday (December 11), stating that the United States hosting the “Leaders’ Democracy Summit” to “make democracy tool-oriented and weapon-oriented based on ideology, to implement anti-democracy in the name of democracy, so as to incite division and confrontation and to shift domestic contradictions”.
中国政府认为 ， " 长期以来，美国将自己的政治制度和价值理念强加于人，推行'民主改造 ' ， 滥施单边制裁，策动'颜色革命 ' ， 造成灾难性后果。	According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has been imposing its own political systems and values on others, carried out ‘democratic transformation’, used unilateral sanction indiscriminately and has instigated ‘Color Revolution’, leading to disastrous consequences.
'民主'早已成为美国干涉别国的'大规模杀伤性武器 ' 。	“Democracy has long become the weapon of mass destruction the United States used to interfere with other countries.
此次峰会是拜登兑现其竞选承诺的行动。	The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign.
为期两天的会议以视频方式进行，全球111个国家领导人应邀与会，其中包括台湾领导人，但中国和俄罗斯没有受到邀请。	The meetings during the 2-days summit were held via video call, and leaders from 111 countries were invited to attend the meeting, including the leaders of Taiwan; however, leaders of China and Russia were not invited.
峰会前夕，中国和俄罗斯就以美国自身民主出现问题抨击美国，称美国没有资格主持召开这样的峰会。	China and Russia attacked the U.S. for what was wrong with its own democracy before the summit, and said that the U.S. did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.
而国际上和美国国内也有质疑声音，例如批评受邀与会的包括一些有威权专制倾向的领导人，比如菲律宾、波兰和巴西等国的领导人，有人怀疑拜登政府的真正意图并非为了民主而是为了地缘政治目的组织了这次峰会。	There were doubts internationally and in the U.S.; for example, the U.S. was criticized for inviting leaders who had the tendency to be authoritarians, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspected that the real intention of the Biden government was geopolitics, not democracy.
刚上任的德国总理肖尔茨也参加了视频民主峰会	German Chancellor Scholz who just took office also attended the video Democracy Summit.
中国外交部周六的声明称 ， " 今天的美式民主病态尽显，金钱政治、身份政治、政党对立、政治极化、社会撕裂、种族矛盾、贫富分化等问题愈演愈烈 " ， 美国的民主是建立在资本基础上的"富人游戏 " 。	According to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, “the American democracy today is morbid, with increasingly obvious problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts and polarization of the rich and the poor”, and the democracy of the U.S. was the “game of the rich” established based on the capital.
美国总统拜登在发言中表示 ， " 作为政府的领导人，我们有责任倾听我们的公民，加固民主的护栏，推动改革，实现透明的问责治理，更能抵御专制的缓冲和冲击的力量，以及那些想在公共利益之前赤裸裸地追求权力的人 。 "	The U.S. President, Biden, expressed in his speech, “as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to ideas of our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms and realize transparent accountability and governance, to fight against the power of impact of buffer of autocracy and those who bluntly pursue power before public benefits.”
他强调，民主并不是想当然的 ， " 我们必须在每一代人当中不断更新它，在我看来，这是我们这个时代的决定性挑战 。 "	He emphasized that democracy should not be taken for granted, “we must keep update it in every generations which is, in my opinion, the decisive challenge of our era.”
拜登还说，全球民主及人权"面对持续且令人忧心的挑战之际，民主需要斗士来捍卫 " 。	Biden also said that global democracy and human rights are “facing continuous and worrying challenges, and democracy should be guarded by fighters”.
美国方面承诺，在本次民主峰会后，将展开为期一年的行动，包含一项金额4.244亿美元的倡议，以加强世界各地的民主，并对独立新闻媒体提供支持。	The United States promised that after this Democracy Summit, it will carry out a series of year-long actions including a 424.4 million USD initiative to strengthen democracy around the globe and provide support to independent new media.
美国希望各国在计划于2022年底举行的实体民主峰会前，作出具体的公开承诺，以改善其民主制度。	The U.S. wants all countries to make specific and open promises before the democratic summit held at the end of 2022, so as to improve the democratic system.
拜登说 ， " 让我们所有国家都落实我们的承诺并在明年报告我们所取得的进展 " 。	Biden said, “let’s all fulfill our promises and report our progresses next year”.

每个人的爱好不同，有人喜欢收藏，有人喜欢美食，当然也有人喜欢品酒，红牌威士忌是目前各个国家最畅销的苏格兰威士忌之一，而且红牌威士忌曾获国际洋酒大赛金奖。	Different people have different preferences; some like to collect, some like food, and certainly some like wine tasting; Johnnie Walker Red Label is one of the fastest selling Scottish whiskies in the world and has won the gold prize of International Wine Competition.
每一瓶红牌威士忌都有独特的味道，不过如果不知道如何品味它，岂不是糟蹋了它的醇香。	Each bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky has its own unique flavor, but if you don’t know how to taste it, it would be such a waste of its mellow fragrance.
那么红牌威士忌怎么喝呢？	Then how do we drink Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky?
小编为大家简单介绍下。	I’ll introduce for you now.

教育思考：大学考试如何让“学霸 ” “ 学渣”各得其所-新华网	Thought on Education: How do examinations in college allow straight A students and slack students both get what they deserve - Xinhuanet
兰州交通大学3名学生给校领导写信，反映对大学考试的困惑，并提出提高考试难度，变换考试题型，让考试真正体现学生实际水平的诉求。	Three students in Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to leaders of the university to reflect their confusion on examinations in university, and raised the ideas to increase the difficulty of examinations, change types of questions and let the examinations reflect the real learning level of students.
的确，长期以来，大学考试都是一个“热门话题 ” 。	Indeed, examinations in universities have been a “heated topic“ for a long time.
在大学校园，学生来自五湖四海，能力水平各不相同，再加之学习程度不一，学习的情况千差万别。	Students on campus come from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels; due to different efforts spent in study, their situations of study vary significantly.
对于具有如此多元特征的群体进行考核，存在不同感受，在所难免。	It is inevitable for different feelings about the examinations to exist in such a diversified group.
当然，如果考试试题题型单一、重复率高，题目过于简单，必然会造成另一种截然不同的感受。	Certainly, it will cause a completely different experience if there are few types of questions, the questions are repetitive or too simple.
不用功的学生，可能考前集中突击就能及格，如若再想其他办法，有可能达到事半功倍的效果。	Students who do not study hard can pass the exam after cramming before the exam; if they think of other ways, they may half the work with double results.
如此一来，就出现“学渣”平时不投入也能过关、甚至得了高分 ； “ 学霸”平时从不落课，作业、笔记样样好，考试也没高出多少的“怪现状 ” 。	As such, there will be a “strange phenomenon where “slack students” who don’t ordinarily study pass the exam and even getting high scores; “straight A” students who never miss any class, take notes, do assignments get scores that are not much higher.
这样看来，兰州交大的学生反映大学考试中存在的问题并非毫无来由，相信这种状况也不只兰州交大存在。	In this way, the problems in college exams reflected by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not groundless; it is believed that such situations do not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
从这层意义上讲，要为这3名写信直陈的学生点赞。	In this sense, we should applaud for the three students who wrote the letter to reflect the problem directly.
其实，上过大学的人都清楚，突击备考、想各种办法从老师处“套取”考题，争取划考试范围，求得考前得到“重点辅导”的现象并不少见，甚至在考试中夹带小抄、考后求老师高抬贵手的情况也不是奇闻。	In fact, people who have been to colleges know that the phenomena of cramming for an exam, “trying to winkle” exam questions from teachers, trying to get the scope of the questions and acquiring “key tutoring” before exam are not rare; further, bringing notes to exams or begging teachers to give higher marks after exams are not rare, either.
在笔者看来，作为一种教学质量评估导向，衡量一所大学考试的合格与否，更在于教师对教与学的全面把握，以及在此基础上的科学命题。	In the view of the author, as a guidance for teaching quality evaluation, judging if the exams in a college are qualified or not relies more on the comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the setting questions scientifically on this basis.
进入大学本科阶段，专业开始细分，很多专业课程以基础知识为主。	Majors are segmented after entering the undergraduate study, and many specialized courses are carried out with basic knowledge as the main content.
毋庸置疑，是否全面掌握一个学科的基本知识点，是大学考试要考察的内容。	Undoubtedly, whether the students have mastered the basic knowledge is a content to be inspected in the exams in college.
而本科知识基本都是学科基础理论和基本常识，从知识点而言，变化的空间并不大，基本是固定的。	Knowledge during the undergraduate study is mainly basic theories and common sense of the subject, and in terms of knowledge points, they are basically unchanged and there is not much room for variation.
就像有教师所言 ， “ 20年前学大学数学的基本知识，现在还在学，还是重点 。 ”	As some teachers have said, “the mathematical basic knowledge in college twenty years ago is still being taught today and it is still a key content.”
但知识点基本不变，并不代表考试题型单一、试题重复。	However, the unchanging basic knowledge points do not mean there can be single type or repetitive questions.
在很多大学，考试一般都会组成出题组，再由学科资深教师统筹组成试卷，考试阅卷也由承担该科的全体老师参与，这样就能在一定程度上克服试题重复的情况。	There will usually be a group working on setting test questions for the exams, and senior teachers of the subject will coordinate and compile a test paper; marking test papers will be undertaken by all teachers of the subject; this can in a sense overcome the situation of repetitive questions.
但要拟出一套符合教与学实际的试题，题目根据学生学习整体情况，难易呈正态分布，还需综合掌握教学情况，全面分析学生学习的程度，从而使考试命题对难易、题型有动态把握，既能突出基础知识考察，又能兼顾能力考查，同时对题型进行创新设计。	In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficulty degree according to general learning conditions of students; it is also required to learn about the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze how well the students have learned so as to have a good command of the level of difficulty and type of question in designing the test paper, giving priority to inspection of basic knowledge, and testing their ability at the same time; creative designs on the type of question can be made as well.
考试是大学教育的指挥棒，有什么样的考试，学生就会有相应的备考方案，长此以往，将影响大学教育的成效。	College exam is the baton of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exams will influence the effect of college education in the long run.
对于学生的建议信，兰州交大校方高度重视，已在全校部署了整改的方案。	Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter of advise from the students; it has deployed the scheme for rectification in the university.
要求各教学单位组织教师开展研讨和课程结课考试对照自查，制定考试试卷命题及相关制度，同时加强对考试试卷命题及审核环节的监督与检查，细化成绩评定，加强课程教学各环节的全面考核。	It requires all teaching units to organize teachers to deliberate and conduct self-inspection on exams at the end of a course, formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and review, specify grade evaluation work, and strengthen comprehensive inspection on various links of course teaching.
从机制上解决试题类型单一、题目重复等问题是大学考务需要面对的议题，当然需要出台相应的制度，但功夫贵在日常，需要教师对教学情况的全面掌握，不单要吃透教学内容，更须吃透学生学习情况，两头吃透，教与学将更好对接，形成良性互动，考试也将更加符合实际，从而让“学霸”和“学渣”各得其所。	Solving problems such as types of questions are few and repetitive questions by way of changing the system is a task that college exam administration needs to deal with; regulations need to be issued, but efforts should be made in normal times; it requires teachers to comprehensive master the teaching and learning situation; they need to not only master their teaching content but also the learning situation of the students; mastering both can better connect teaching and learning, forming an effective interaction; exams will be more fit for the actual situation, and straight A students and slack students can both get what they deserve.

拍照之前因为我们时间没安排好，更换了两次时间，顾问兰兰很耐心地帮我们安排了时间。	Because I didn’t arrange my time well before the shoot, I rescheduled twice and consultant Lanlan patiently arranged time for us.
后来选择了一个天气好的周末拍的。	Later we chose a weekend with nice weather to shoot it.
金夫人的工作人员，无论是顾问，化妆师还是摄影师都超赞的。	The staff at Mrs. Gold, no matter it’s consultant or makeup artist, are fantastic.

晓洁和另一个妹子（抱歉我记不得名字了）化妆超级有耐心，化妆也很自然。	Xiaojie and the other girl (sorry, I forgot her name) were super patient while doing my makeup and the makeup was natural.
外景在江湾城拍的，幸亏那天天气很好，没有觉得很冷，拍照的时候，化妆师时不时地留意我们的衣服，头饰，稍微有一点不好了就马上帮我们整理。	We shot the outdoor scene at Jiangwancheng, and fortunately the weather was nice that day, we didn’t feel cold; during the shoot, makeup artist was paying attention to our clothes, headwear, and made adjustment immediately once there was a problem.
摄影师也非常幽默，拍照一天下来都觉得很开心。	The photographer was funny, and we were happy throughout the day.
在选照片的时候，因为在网上看到很多案例，不愿意让客人删太多照片，但是我们选照片的时候，真的，一点没有让我们加照片的意思，直接套餐里的24张，一张都没有加（听说和我差不多时间拍婚纱照的表妹，七千多的套餐还加了一万多的照片，当时我就惊呆了，心里也很怕自己会选太多）	When choosing the photos, I saw many cases online where they wouldn’t let the customers delete too many photos, but they didn’t ask us to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the set and nothing more (I heard that my cousin who was also taking wedding dress photos added photos worth over 10,000 in addition to the 7,000 yuan set, and I was stunned and feared I might choose too many).
今天照片修好了，兰兰发给我，我看了有两张觉得不太好，他们立刻就帮我重新修了。	The editing was finished today and Lanlan sent it to me; I felt two were not good enough and they immediately re-edited them for me.
把妹妹以前拍的照片翻出来对比，我觉得我们的照片我真的太满意了，简约清新，就是我想要的风格。	I found the old photos of my sister to make comparison, and I felt that our photos were really satisfying, simple and fresh, exactly what I wanted.
真心推荐大家去宣汉金夫人拍婚纱照！	I sincerely recommend choosing Xuanhan Mrs. Gold to take your wedding dress photoshoot!

（亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。	(Kota Kinabalu News on the 11th) According to the National Registration Bureau of Sabah, new infants cannot be provided with birth certificates from the beginning of October due to supply shortage of the specially made security paper; a total of 3,200 infants have been influenced so far.
不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。	However, director of the bureau, Kerouaminus, promised that the data of all the infants applying for birth certificate has been recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued as soon as the security paper arrives next week.
他在新闻发布会上，针对一家网媒指沙巴报生纸印制问题出现长达10个月的报导，作出解释。	He made the explanation at the press conference regarding to an online media’s report that the paper shortage of birth certificates in Sabah has been going on for ten months.
他说，有关问题在2个月前就出现，砂拉越也面对同样的问题。	He said that related problems started 2 months ago, and that Sarawak is also facing this problem.
“其中一个原因是生产特制防伪纸的中国厂家受疫情影响，导致延迟运抵我国 。 ”	“One of the reasons is that the manufacturers of the security paper in China are influenced by the epidemic, leading to a delay in delivery to our country.”
他解释，沙巴报生纸使用的防伪纸和其他地区不同，因此不能商借其他州属的存货。	He explained that the security paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from that of other regions, and therefore stock in other regions cannot be borrowed.
凯鲁阿米努斯透露，最新一批防伪纸已经于本月6日运抵吉隆坡，过后于8日交给印刷公司，进行部分印制工作。	Kerouaminus disclosed that the latest batch of security paper has been delivered to Kuala Lumpur on December 6, and was handed over to the printing company on December 8 for part of the printing work.
“该局下周四将派人到吉隆坡取货，回到沙巴立刻进行最后阶段的打印，估计多2个工作日（12月20日）就可以交到申请者手上 。 ”	“The National Registration Bureau of Sabah will dispatch staffs to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to complete the printing of the last stage after returning to Sabah, and it is estimated that they can be given out to the applicants at most 2 working days later (December 20).”
“我们会通知申请者前往各地分局领取报生纸 。 ”	“We’ll notify the applicants to get the birth certificates at their local branch bureau.”
他补充，沙巴今年至今共发出2万4801张报生纸。	He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
从 7 点多等到现在	I’ve been waiting since 7 o’clock.
那是不是就快到了？	Will it arrive soon?
我指的是食物	I meant the food.
我又在#PRS_ORG#对面等	I waited again across the #PRS_ORG#.
好好，谢谢，因餐厅说已准备好	Okay, thank you, because the restaurant said it has prepared

以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚持统筹国内国际两个大局，坚持稳中求进工作总基调，沉着应对百年变局和世纪疫情，统筹疫情防控和经济社会发展，加快构建新发展格局，强化宏观政策跨周期调节，着力促进经济持续健康发展，着力深化改革开放创新，奋力完成改革发展艰巨任务，党和国家各项事业取得了新的重大成就。	The Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping as the core insists on taking both the domestic and international situations into consideration, adheres to the general tone of seeking progress in stability, calmly copes with the great changes in the past one hundred years and the epidemic of the century, coordinates epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development as a whole, accelerates the construction of the new development pattern, strengthens the cross cyclical adjustment of macro policies, lays emphasis on promoting continuous healthy development of economy and deepening reform, opening up and innovation, and works hard to complete reform and development tasks; new significant achievements in various undertakings of the Party and our country have been made.

我国经济发展和疫情防控保持全球领先地位，发展韧性强、潜力大、动力足的特点持续显现；国家战略科技力量加快壮大，重大创新成果竞相涌现，科技创新能力持续提升，关键核心技术攻关实现新突破；产业链韧性得到提升，对外贸易量增质升，结构继续优化，以新产业新业态新模式为代表的新动能成长壮大；改革开放向纵深推进，着力打通制约供需适配和要素流动的堵点，以高水平对外开放打造合作竞争新优势；民生保障有力有效，就业规模持续扩大，居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步，全年粮食连续7年保持在1.3万亿斤以上，喜获“十八连丰 ” ； 生态文明建设持续推进，碳达峰碳中和工作统筹推进，绿色低碳转型步伐稳健，生态环境保护取得新成效。	The economic development and epidemic prevention and control of our country is a leading position in the world, with the characteristics of strong development tenacity, great potential and sufficient motivation continuing to emerge; the strategic scientific and technological strength has expanded in an accelerated way, with significant innovative achievements emerging continuously; the scientific and technological innovation ability is continuously improved, leading to new breakthroughs in key and core technologies; the industry chain tenacity is improved, and the foreign trade quantity and quality have been elevated, structure is further optimized, and new kinetic energy represented by new industries, new business forms and new models grows and expands; the reform and opening up are promoted in a deeper way, so as to break through the blocking points restraining the matching of the supply and the demand and the flowing of factors, and to build new competitiveness for cooperation with high-standard opening up; the guarantee of people’s livelihood is powerful and effective, employment scale is further expanded, and personal income growth is basically in step with economic growth; the grain output of the whole year has been more than 1.3 trillion jin for 7 consecutive years, getting “good harvest for 18 consecutive years”; the construction of ecological civilization has been continuously promoted, and the peak carbon dioxide emissions and the carbon neutrality works have been planned as a whole, the green low-carbon transformation has been ongoing in a steady way, and ecological environment has made new achievements.
这些成绩的取得，是以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导的结果，是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想科学指引的结果，是全党全国各族人民勠力同心、艰苦奋斗的结果。	These achievements are the results of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping as its core, the results of the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping thought on socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the new era, and the results of unity and hard work of the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups in China.
实践再次证明，党确立习近平同志党中央的核心、全党的核心地位，确立习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的指导地位，对新时代党和国家事业发展、对推进中华民族伟大复兴历史进程具有决定性意义。	It is proved by practice again that the establishment of the position of Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the Party, and the establishment of the guiding position of Xi Jinping thought on socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the new era play a decisive role in promoting the development of the Party and the country in the new era and in propelling the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网	Negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours and setting up a "buffer zone", the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News
新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。	Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice about strengthening epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, asking people who recently left land border port cities (except those connected with ports of Hong Kong and Macao) to hold the negative result of nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and people who go to the land border port cities should take the nucleic acid test at least once after arrival.
根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。	According to the notice, the time range of the aforementioned request is from the date when the province, autonomous region and city determine the scope of port cities and announce it until March 15, 2022.
此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。	In addition, the notice also requests that port cities with the capability can study the possibility of setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction.
国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。	According to the introduction of the person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main local economic pillar and the border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。	The implementation of the policy of zoning and differentiated management is to make one defense line of the spread of prevention and control into two lines, make it possible to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost.
近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。	Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks of diagnosed cases in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。	The notice points out that this has exposed some problems, such as the untimely monitoring and warning of epidemic in some places, the non-existing implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, the inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items in all links, the non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and the unscientific and inaccurate emergency response of epidemic situation.
通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。	The notice requests that efforts should be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, deliver the prevention and control work scientifically, accurately and without relaxing, as well as to strengthen the defense line of curbing imported cases.
通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。	The notice stresses that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and safeguard people's livelihood at the same time, publish and monitor the smooth running of the people's livelihood hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic life necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
根据通知，其中所指的口岸城市包括开放的陆路、水路、航空口岸所在县（市、区、旗 ） 、 所在市（地、州、盟）及所在直辖市，具体范围由各省（自治区、直辖市）根据疫情防控需要确定并及时公告。	According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (areas, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and specific scope shall be determined and timely announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the demand of epidemic prevention and control.

本店不接受与想像中的不一样，款式风格不合为理作为退换和中差评的理由，	We do not accept exchange or refunding or medium or negative reviews due to the product received being different from what you imagined or the style is not suitable for you,

油管视频起底美军20年嗜血杀戮真相-新华网	YouTube video uncovers the truth of US army’s bloodthirsty killing of 20 years - Xinhuanet
（视频来源：油管）	(source of video: YouTube)
12月11日，油管平台一条名为《杀戮机器》的微纪录片引起广泛关注。	On December 11, a short documentary named Killing Machine went viral on YouTube.
该片讲述了美国以“反恐”为名发动阿富汗战争，通过战争强行输出美式民主，20年穷兵黩武、嗜血成性、滥杀无辜，犯下种种反人类罪行。	The documentary tells of various kinds of antihuman crimes committed by the US, including launching the war against Afghanistan in the name of “anti-terrorism”, outputting American democracy forcefully via wars, exhausting its resources to build up its military power, being obsessive about bloodthirsty killing, and massacring the innocent at will for 20 years.
滥用无人机空袭医院、学校等民用场所，扭曲人性，成立杀人小组。	The US army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing squad with distorting human nature.
20年来，美军杀害了数万阿富汗无辜平民。	The US army has killed dozens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians for 20 years.
美军设“黑狱”对“嫌犯”施加种种酷刑、人身羞辱。	The US army set up “black prison” to apply various cruel tortures and personal humiliation to “suspects”.
一桩桩反人类罪行激起更多阿富汗人的仇恨。	Countless antihuman crimes stirred up hatred from even more Afghan civilians.
正如视频所说，美式“反恐”战争“越反越恐 ” 。	Just as what the video says, American anti-terrorism war “is creating more terrorism”.
战争没有给阿富汗人民带去和平民主、繁荣希望，带去的只有满目疮痍的国家和无数的杀戮破坏。	The war did not bring peacefulness, democracy, prosperity or hope to Afghan people; instead, they threw the country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction.
戳视频，让我们一起来揭穿美国以“反恐”为名，嗜血杀戮的真相，戳穿美式民主的虚伪假面！	Let us click on the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorism” of the US, and rip off the false mask of American democracy!
无意中看到如下一篇文章，从商业的角度以及保存期的角度谈为什么这个客户要保税区里面的物流公司帮做罐装，虽然罐装属于深加工，不属于保税物流公司的经营范围，这里如下这篇文字也许可以解释 为什么客户想要这么做？	I came across the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life; although canning is deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text perhaps can explain why the customer wants to do this.
我去很多奶粉的厂家，接触很多奶粉的生产线。	I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and gained contact with many production lines of milk powder.
其实袋装跟听装的奶粉它们的原材料是一模一样的，没有任何区别的。	Actually, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and in cans are exactly the same.
那么大家肯定会问：为什么袋装保质期是一年，而听装的保质期是两年或更长呢？	Then you may ask: why is the shelf life of milk powder one year in bags and two years or longer in cans?
或者又问：听装与袋装的价格为什么差价这么大呢？	Or you may ask: why are the prices of bagged and canned milk powder so different?
其实从这点出发很多消费者，或者妈妈级的认为这是因为原材料不一样所以质量上会好很多。	Actually, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
其实原材料一样，只是大家认为贵的就是好的。	Actually, the raw materials are the same, and people just think the goods are more expensive because they are better.
也有消费者出于这种心态吃了后反应还说听装的口感或味道就是不一样！	There are also customers in this mindset who say that the taste is indeed different after drinking it!
现在我跟大家先说一下听装贵的原因，贵在哪里？	Now I will introduce why the canned ones are expensive.
它们的原材料相同为何差价如此之大呢？	Why are the prices so different when the raw materials are the same?
因为厂家在定价的时候大多数都考虑到如果袋装定价太高，消费者很难去接受，这就意味着厂家产生的利润很低，或者说没有利润，那厂家靠什么去生存呢？	When the manufacturers set the price, they know that if they price too high, it is difficult for the customers to accept and the profits will be very low for the manufacturers or there will be no profit at all; then what will the manufacturers live on?
所以他们在听装的定价上，有了一个很大的上升幅度来保障他们的利润空间。	Therefore, in the price setting of the canned ones, they set it much higher to guarantee their profits.
因此大多数厂家主推的是听装，而不是袋装。	As a result, many manufacturers recommend canned ones instead of bagged ones.
还有你想那么多的厂家每年的广告费都要几千万甚至是几个亿，这个费用何来？	Just think about where the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions yuan advertising fee of the manufacturers come from every year.
大家可想而知。	Everyone knows it.
那么随着社会的发展，市场的推广费用，比如说：商场的促销人员、商场的陈列费用、产品的赠品费用、广告费用等也在不断的增加。	With the development of society, the market promotion expenses kept increasing, such as the cost of promotion personnel at shopping malls, the display expenses of products at shopping malls, the cost of gifts of products, advertising expenses, etc.
所以各个厂家也在不断地增加新品，而且是听装，其价格也是不断地上涨，其实这是随着市场费用的增加而出的新品。	Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products in can packaging, and the price kept rising as well; in fact, these new product are introduced due to the increase of market costs.
主要目的是为了获取更高的利润，其实他们的原材料增加的成本最多不会超过3、4元钱。	The main objective is to gain more profits; the increased cost of raw materials is actually no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
还有一部分品牌，为了推广自己的产品，不择手段，跟医院的医生挂钩，由他们协助产品的推广，从一听里面抽成30元到80元不等的利润。	There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, cooperate with doctors in the hospital by all means, and ask them to assist in the promotion of products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from one can.
而中国的相关法律是绝对不允许这样的操作方式方法的，其实这种做法是在坑害消费者。	China’s relevant laws by no means allow such operations because this practice is in fact harming consumers.
建议大家在家里有罐的前提下买袋装的奶粉装入罐中，这样可以节省费用，而增加奶粉的保存性和密封性，对小孩子也没有任何影响。	It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans if you have cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation time and hermetic seal of milk powder; it won’t have any influence on the children.
还有大家不要认为听装的保质期就比袋装长，如果在开包以后听装与袋装的保质期是一样的，只是说袋装开包以后不容易保存，容易受潮变质。	Also, don’t think that the shelf life of canned ones is longer than that of bagged ones; the shelf life of canned ones is the same as that of bagged ones after unpacked; it’s just that bagged ones are not easy to be preserved and are easy to become damp and deteriorate.
送餐迟了，食物都凉了，凉了后又干又硬，完全没办法吃	The delivery was late, and after the food got cold, it was dry and hard, completely inedible.
而且汤汁还洒了出来	Also the soup was spilled.
立即取消，他 #PRS_ORG# 补送来的东西肯定都凉了	Cancel it immediately, the stuff he #PRS_ORG# resends here must be cold.
我没拿过！	I didn’t take it!
#NAME# 说你们没有人去拿	#NAME# said no one went to pick it up.
我们打电话过去了	We called.
你不退款的话我就报警	I’ll call the police if you don’t refund it.
多次用#PRS_ORG#，今天这次是最差的体验	I’ve used #PRS_ORG# many times, and today I had the worst experience.
完全不能接受	Totally unacceptable.
好的，可以	Okay, fine.
但也要提醒餐厅及骑手	But you need to remind the restaurant and delivery person.
避免下次再发生	To prevent it from happening again.
我想知道确切的送餐时间	I want to know the exact delivery time.
那个时间不断延迟	The time kept being put off.
不知道要等到什么时候	I don’t know how much longer do I have to wait.
如果取消订单，可不可以退回钱款	If I cancel the order, can I get the money back?
想向骑手支付服务费，怎么给？	I want to pay service fee to the delivery person, how can I do it?
一个多小时前已确认有一名骑手	It was confirmed more than an hour ago that there was a delivery person.

不要把人吓倒在起跑线-新华网	Don’t scare people off at the starting line - Xinhuanet
逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。	We can usually feel the popularity of books on success when we go to bookstores.
现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。	Many books on success nowadays advocate the “best principle”, which first assumes or implies that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what it is” that you need to do.
等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。	It skips the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it”.
正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。	As such, these books have one common characteristic; you either work to be the best or do nothing at all; you either be 100 or be 0; you either climb on Mount Tai or stay where you are.
这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。	The “best principle” will make every reader believe it is “absolutely right”, but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.
因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。	Because this theory advocates a route in which “you have to be resolute to start again and change 180 degrees”, and this happens to be the weakest point of many people.
对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。	Shouting “you need to change” to people who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change is lying to yourself and casting pearls before swine.
绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。	The majority of people will be timid in front of “change”, reluctant to move forward or make the decision; or, they have made the decision to “change” on an impulse and bravely taken the first step, but it doesn’t last long and they will lose courage after persevering for while; they cannot be persistent.
马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。	From Tomorrow On, the famous sketch from Mr. Ma Sanli, most vividly depicts the classic of “common humanity”.
“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。	The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the threshold is too high; it surpasses the limit of the ability of ordinary people and leave most people “sigh at the beginning”.
或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。	Or, the “second best principle” perhaps is a route for more ordinary people to be successful.
“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。	The core of the “second best principle” is lowering the threshold; it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot.
总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。	Anyway, doing anything is better than doing nothing at all.
由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。	Due to the dramatic lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher; the success rate will be higher for anything as long as you persevere,
只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。	It’s just that the journey will be longer if you follow the “second best principle”.
总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。	In all, although the “best principle” on the surface claims to make everyone successful, it will eventually only encourage few people in actuality; the “second best principle” can effectively encourage more people and make more people actually gain benefit.
那我现在是否需要重新下订单？	Do I need to re-place the order now?
电话无人接听	The phone was not answered.
不停延误	Kept being delayed.
还没送到	Still not delivered.
请问，几时送到？	May I ask when it will arrive?
可如何联系？	How do I gain contact?
请取消订单	Please cancel the order.
我不能再等了，谢谢	I can’t wait any longer, thanks.
他差两个餐没送，但有个 order 已完结	He still has two food orders to deliver, but one order has completed.
我想问一下，要如何联系骑手	I want to know how to contact the delivery person.
刚才第一个骑手跟我讲，应该会有另外一个骑手再送	The first delivery person told me that another delivery person would send it again.
青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网	The reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in the Qinghai Lake have increased by 7.1 thousand tons - Xinhuanet
新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。	Report from Xinhua News Agency Xining on December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons; there is a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with that in the initial stage of protection in 2002.
青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。	Gymnocypris przewalskii, commonly known as “scaleless carp”, is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays an indispensable role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water, fish, bird” ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。	In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocypris przewalskii has decreased sharply due to the human hunting in vast quantities and the increasingly degraded environment of breeding waters of gymnocypris przewalskii, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2,592 tons.
2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。	In 2004, gymnocypris przewalskii was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。	From 2003, Qinghai province implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibited any unit, collective or individual from fishing gymnocypris przewalskii in the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of gymnocypris przewalskii and their products.
与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。	In the meantime, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources have increased year by year through artificial breeding and releasing, clearing of the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and river courses, designing scientific and reasonable “fish passage” and other measures to continue to strengthen protection.
青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。	Yang Lin, Deputy Director General of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up until now, nearly 180 million gymnocypris przewalskii have been artificially reproduced and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of gymnocypris przewalskii resources.
青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。	Qinghai three-rivers area is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
为了保护三江源地区和青海湖水域生态环境、保护水生野生动物，维护青藏高原生物多样性，今年以来，青海先后发布长江、黄河、青海湖重点水域禁捕通告，构建起了“一江一河一湖”全面禁捕管理体系。	In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice banning fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive management system of fishing ban of “one river, one river, and one lake”.

已经 1 个小时了，都还没送到	It has been 1 hour and it still has not been delivered yet.
刚看到一篇写例假的文章，太长了。	I just read an article about period, and it’s too long.
给不知道的男性科普一下。	I’ll introduce to men who don’t know about it.
大部分女孩子会在13-15岁期间的某一天突然经历第一次例假，在50岁左右闭经。	Most girls will get their first period between 13 to15 years old, and have amenorrhea around 50.
之后身体健康的前提下会比较规律地每个月来一次。	Then they get period regularly once every month on the premise of good health.
但也不是规律到能精准预测，大概一周左右的公差，需要提前准备，有时候运气差也会翻车（突然提前好几天）。	But it is not so regular that you can precisely predict it; there is a difference of around a week; you need to prepare early and sometimes you may get unlucky and it arrives several days earlier.
时间长度、血量、痛经程度因人而异，有些人三天，有些人一周；有些人流的少，有些人大血崩；有些人没什么反应，有些人疼到救护车运走，痛经随着时间会改变，以前不痛不代表一辈子不痛。	The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person; some people have it for three days and some people a week; some people have small flow and some people have way too much; some people don’t have any reaction, and some people feel so painful that they have to be taken away by the ambulance; dysmenorrhea will change over time, and not having it before doesn’t mean it won’t happen for a lifetime.
月经无法控制，开始到结束为止的几天内24小时流血，能做的只有用卫生巾或卫生棉条吸血防止流到衣服椅子上。	You can’t control menstruation; you bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is absorb blood with pads or tampons to prevent it from getting onto clothes or chairs.
痛经主要是因为前列腺素的分泌，生理期刚开始还没来得及痛经时赶紧吃布洛芬可有效缓解当月疼痛，痛经开始后再吃没什么用。	Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins; Taking ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain of dysmenorrhea that month before menstruation begins, but taking it is useless to after dysmenorrhea begins.
生理期前由于子宫充血和前列腺素释放过多，容易拉肚子。	It is easy to have diarrhea before the period due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
如果大概到了周期，莫名其妙拉肚子，基本上两天内会来月经。	If you are near the cycle and you have diarrhea for no reason at all, you will basically get your period within two days.
卫生巾最好两三个小时更换一次，不然容易滋生细菌，除去睡眠时间，最坏的情况是一天更换6次，每月7天，那就是42片，如果加上提前准备的份可能有50片，并不是每个月用一片。	It is best to replace sanitary pads every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria; apart from sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, and that is 42 pieces; if you add the ones prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not just one piece every month.
（此处修改一下，卫生棉条不必常换，大概五六小时换一次就可以，最长八小时）	(a little modification here, tampons do not need to be changed often; it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
月经期荷尔蒙作祟可能会比较暴躁，排卵期也会因为体内激素变化情绪不稳定，就是很倒霉，身体给自己使绊子。	Hormones during menstruation may make you irritable, and ovulation may also make you emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very troublesome; your body makes itself suffer.
但官方犯罪率数据能看出女性控制情绪的能力还是很高的，也不会拿情绪问题找借口。	However, you may see from the official crime rate data that women’s ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
流的并不只是血，其中包含脱落的子宫内膜。	It’s not just blood, but also endometrium that fall off.
月经结束后的子宫内膜最薄，之后慢慢变厚，可以理解为子宫是房子，每个月建房子（内膜变厚）准备迎接客人，客人没有来，全部拆掉（月经排出）下个月再建新房子，周而复始。	After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens; you may think that the uterus is a house; you build a house every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests, and if the guests do not come, all of them are demolished (menstruation flows out) and a new house is built next month, which starts again and again.
月经很不方便，连续几十年，每个月几天24小时流血，还会腹痛腰痛，谁愿意？	Menstruation is very inconvenient; you bleed 24 hours a few days a month for dozens of years, and it also causes abdominal pain and lower back pain; who would want that?
但是人能出生是因为他的母亲来过月经，月经是为了准备你第一次来到这个世界时要住10个月的房子，大家要感谢自己的母亲规律健康的来过月经。	But people are born because their mother has menstruation; menstruation exists to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months before you come to this world; everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
以前女性的很多事情被打压，社会给女性洗脑说是肮脏的，羞耻的，大家以为就是那样了，但时代变了。	In the past, many things about women were suppressed; society brainwashed women and told them it’s dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that it was like that; but times have changed.
如果有人觉得月经恶心，觉得女性的身体为孕育生命做出的准备行为恶心，不该在大庭广众之下说出来，女孩子们站起来，不要再这么想，从未经历过，这辈子也不会经历，也不怎么了解的男性们，不要那么忘恩负义不知好歹，这种态度怎么好意思面对自己的母亲，怎么好意思想要自己的孩子？	If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, the female body’s preparation for life is disgusting, and it shouldn’t be said in public; girls, stand up and don’t think this way; men who have never experienced it, won’t experience it in this life, and don’t know much about it, don’t be so ungrateful and unkind; how can you face your mother and children in this attitude?
最后，姐妹们试试卫生棉条吧，真的好用。	Finally, sisters, try tampons; they are really easy to use.
今天是冬至节日，送错比较让人失望	Today is the Winter Solstice, and delivering the wrong thing is quite disappointing.
要另外订餐给小朋友吃	Please place another order for the children.
希望店铺百忙之中都要检查一下出品	I hope the store can set aside some time out of its busy schedule to check the quality of the products.
足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？	Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?
选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。	Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you.
随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。	As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options.
在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。	According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk.
“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”	“Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!”
李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。	Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it.
李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。	Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function.
李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。	Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.
后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。	Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it.
因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。	Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc.
但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。	But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.
因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。	Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin.
水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。	There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated.
同时你可以随便拿电笔测。	Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it.

本人在此衷心感谢各位朋友在我们亲人遇难后的30多年漫长期间内所给予的人道救助，尤其是在我1994年初曾以个人名义向国内外友人发出过人道救助呼吁以来，迄今为止未曾中断的救助。	I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after the death of our family, especially the uninterrupted assistance since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name at the beginning of 1994.
现如今绝大多数遇难者的老父母均已谢世，遗孤们也已长大成家就业。	Now the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have also grown up, started working and got married.
是你们的义举帮助我们这些蒙难家庭度过了最为艰难的时刻。	It is your chivalrous deeds that have helped these families in distress pass the most difficult time.
目前新冠疫情正在全球肆虐，大多数的捐款者也已年届退休。	At present, COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
因此，我恳切地请求你们中止给我们难属——天安门母亲群体人道捐款，这项人道救助活动早就应该画上完美的句号了。	Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to the family of victims, Tiananmen Mothers group; this humanitarian relief event should have come to a perfect end long ago.
我将永远铭记你们的爱心，并坚信你们的义举必将为历史铭记。	I will remember your kindness forever and firmly believe your chivalrous deeds will be remembered by history forever.
由于种种原因，我只能以此方式表达自己的意愿，请朋友们谅解！	For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way; please understand!
请接受我诚挚的祝福。	Please accept my sincere wishes.

救助款常常不能顺利送达六四难属手中。	The relief funds often fail to reach the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement successfully.
1994年，经丁老师建议，由“天安门母亲”成立专门小组，统筹和负责人道救助款的接收与分发。	In 1994, Ding advised that the “Tiananmen Mother” set up a special group to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
1998年，MCDF设立《六四孤儿教育基金》，执行11年后，于2009年，在所有六四孤儿都大学毕业后，MCDF继而设立《六四孤苦老人特困户救助基金》，并一直执行至今。	In 1998, MCDF established the “June 4th Orphan Education Fund”; after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from University, MCDF then established the “June 4th Elderly with No Family Destitute Poverty Relief Fund”, which has been implemented until now.
这些项目的资金，主要来自六四当年的校园和社会捐款，来自个人的慷慨捐助，并受到兄弟大学民主基金会的支持。	The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations of generous individual donations in the year of June 4th event, and were supported by the democracy foundation of brother universities.
自2018年起，还得到了劳改研究基金会的支持。	Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Reform through Labor Research Foundation.
直到去年，时隔31年后，六四难属们终于收到了一笔来自香港的当年以六四的名义募捐来的部分捐款。	Last year, after 31 years, the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a part of the donation made by Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th Movement.
在此期间，《中国人权》也在独立地执行它们的人道救助项目。	During this period, China Human Rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief project.
我们理解，丁老师叫停六四捐助，是为捐款人考虑，我们也确实都是一些退休老人，收入并非如退休前充裕，特此对丁老师的“致友人”一信表示感谢。	We understand that Ding called a stop to the June 4th donation for the consideration of the donors; we are indeed retired elderly, and our income is not as much as before; we hereby thank teacher Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
我们会尊重难属们的决定，在两年内终止这一项目，并在需要时，立即恢复。	We will respect the decision of the family of the victims and terminate this project within two years and resume it immediately when necessary.
对于那些多年来一直坚持慷慨解囊，冒着风险递送人道救助款的那些侠肝义胆的同道们，一并表示感谢和敬意。	I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous fellows who have been giving generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian relief funds for many years.

无论从接待、化妆、服装、灯光、摄影到后期都无可挑剔。	It was impeccable, no matter it’s reception, makeup, outfits, lighting or photography.
化妆师特别细腻，会根据你的风格搭配出适合你的妆容，化妆品用的也都是一线的大牌子。	The makeup artist was attentive to details and would choose the makeup most suitable for you based on your style; the makeup products were also from leading brands.
田亮老师就更不用说了，摄影那是相当的专业。	Not to mention Tian Liang, who is really a professional photographer.
整个工作室很有艺术氛围，还有两只小猫咪陪伴玩耍。	The whole studio is artistic, and there are two kittens to play with you.
我们是在北京上班，北京好点的影楼都需要提前半年排队，同事有在北京拍的，看了下成片觉得just so so。	We work in Beijing, and better studios in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance; I have a colleague who did the photoshoot in Beijing and felt the photos were just so so.

我要怎样给钱？	How should I pay?
重送的餐已经送到了	The de-delivered food has arrived.

现在餐厅职员给我打电话	Now the restaurant employee is calling me.
一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。	I am a programming newbie and I want to share my experience.
如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。	If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to get some training , but if you don’t want to, it’s better to study on your own; after all, trainings are expensive and it will take you six months to learn it.
但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。	However, if you want to enter this industry, then training is a great option, especially for those who are extremely not self-disciplined.
要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。	You can choose to teach yourself if you are self-disciplined, but it will be tiring.
当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。	Certainly, selecting a good training agency is very important.
首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。	You need to first look at the faculty of this agency; if it’s not strong enough, you can cross that agency off your list; of course, some new agencies don’t have strong faculties.
其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。	Secondly, you shall do some research on the agency before choosing it; it’s best to contact former students of the agency; after all, only students know how the agency really is and whether the curriculum is good or not.
你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。	Hello, actually I’m not sure how to answer your question since you didn’t introduce your own situation, and learning this is closely related to your situation.
比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。	Such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you are in; all of these are related to what you want to learn or what industry you want to go into.
如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。	If you are a student who haven’t graduated yet, or if you are a computer major and have graduated, then I recommend learning it yourself if you have time, and this is the method with lowest efficiency and cost; many offline and online training agencies are good now, but it comes with great cost and takes a lot of time; it basically needs a concentrated training of three to six months.
但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。	However, if you are in the same situation as I mentioned, it is convenient to learn it yourself; many learning resources are free online, or you can gain access to a lot of training resources on Bilibili; if you don’t know how to search for them, you can contact me according to my bio and get free resources or detailed consultation.
另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。	There are also classic books to supplement your study with videos.
如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。	If you are not a computer major, but you can pay certain amount of money and devote your time to your learning, then I suggest you go to an agency to study; it’ll be easier this way as the teachers will explain in detail and there will be designated people answering your questions; in addition, it’ll be helpful to your study planning or help you get supervision.
而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。	Further, many training agencies will sign employment agreement; they have quota for internal promotion, and you can be recommended to a company after your learning, so that the job interview process can be easier.
以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。	The above is my opinion; as I said, I don’t know about your situation so my introduction is not detailed; if you want to consult other things, you may contact me any time.
我说 1 点前到，我在 App 都看见了	I said it should arrive before 1 o’clock, and I’ve seen it in the App.
什么叫	What is the...
我还没说完，你干什么呢？	I haven’t finished speaking, what are you doing?
本人，承接各种（安装、清洗，维修）、壁挂炉热水器，净水器，洗衣机、空调、马桶、灶头、油烟机、装灯具、擦玻璃，专业美缝，家政服务	I undertake all kinds of housekeeping services including installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall mounted water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lamp installation, glass cleaning, and professional sewing.
感谢那些默默给我点赞的人 ，为了生活努力拼搏 生活很累但要继续	Thanks to everyone who liked my post; I will carry on working hard although life is difficult.
生活不会辜负每一个努力的人 ，喜欢就关注我吧 ，感谢那些默默给我点赞的人	Life will not let hardworking people down; follow me if you like me; thank you to everyone who have liked my post.
生活就是这样，别人只看结果，自己独撑过程，面对生活，我们除了坚强，就是继续，别无选择，路可以回头看但不能回头走……	This is life; others only see the result and you must go through it alone; in the face of life, we can only stay strong and carry on; there is no other choice; you can look back on life, but you cannot relive it...
保洁是工作，也是职责，生活因服务而美丽，服务因用心而精彩。	Cleaning is a job and a responsibility; life is more beautiful with services, and services are wonderful because we work hard.
保洁我们虽然做的是最脏的活，但我们会用最认真的态度把客户家每个角落打扫的干干净净，看到客户满意的笑容和竖起的大拇指，那一刻所有的累都值了，付出终有回报！	Although we do the most dirty work in cleaning, we will try to clean all the corners of the client’s house with our hard work; the moment I see the client’s smile and big thumb up, all the efforts spent are worthwhile; your hard work will pay off!

用心去做方能成功，用细致去塑造精致，美缝我们是认真的。	Do it with heart and we can succeed; we are serious about creating exquisite things with our attention to details, and we are serious about cleaning seams.
给我机会，一定会让你满意的，质量说明一切，因为专业值得被信赖，你的认可是我最鼓励！	Give me a chance and you will be satisfied; quality is everything, because professionalism is worth trusting; your recognition is the best encouragement to me!
当下的各行各业都不好干啊！	At present, there is not one industry that is easy to do!
但是我始终相信，只要认真态度，够坚持，够努力，我就会比别人好一点，至少总比坐着抱怨强吧”！	But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be slightly better than others; it’s at least better than sitting around and complaining!”
一天之计在于晨，所有的美好从清晨开始 希望你携带着快乐、幸运、健康、如意出发 开始新的一天，保持一整天的好心情 早安	Morning is the most important time of the day; all the good things begin in the morning; I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and joy; keep a good mood all day long; good morning.
小时候，幸福是一件东西，拥有就幸福； 长大后，幸福是一个目标，达到就幸福； 成熟后发现，幸福原来是一种心态，领悟就幸福。	When we were children, happiness was a thing, and we were happy when we had it; when we grow up, happiness is a goal, and we will be happy when we reach it; after maturity, I found that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding is happiness.
做最真实最善良的自己，依心而行，无憾今生；人生一条路，走自己的路；人生两件宝：身体好、心情好，漂漂亮亮活到老！	Be the truest and kindest self, act according to your heart, and leave no regrets in your life; life is a road, go your own way; there are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, and you will live a beautiful life!
人生的每个阶段，都会遇到不同的难题。	We will encounter different difficulties in different stages of life.
很多时候，束缚住你的并不是能力，而是积极面对的勇气。	Often times, what is restraining you is not you ability but your courage to face it actively.
既然无法躲避，不如坦然面对。	Since you cannot hide, you’d rather face it.
你越害怕，越会被困难击倒；你若迎难而上，问题终会迎刃而解。	The more scared you are, the easier you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you take it head on, the problem will be solved.
中沙策展人携手举办沙特首届当代艺术双年展-新华网	Exhibition planners of China and Saudi Arabia work together to hold the first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
新华社利雅得12月12日电（记者王海洲 胡冠）沙特阿拉伯首届当代艺术双年展 — — 迪里耶当代艺术双年展，于11日在位于沙特首都利雅得西北部的迪里耶JAX艺术区正式向公众开放，共有来自沙特、中国等地的64位艺术家参展。	Message from Xinhua News Agency Riyadh on December 12 (journalists: Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia, Diriyah contemporary art biennale, was officially opened to the public in the JAX arts district of Diriyah in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on December 11, and a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries and regions participated in the exhibition.
本次双年展由沙特迪里耶双年展基金会和中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心联合策划，中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心馆长田霏宇担任艺术总监。	The biennale is planned jointly by Diriyah biennale foundation of Saudi Arabia and UCCA of China, and Tian Feiyu, curator of UCCA of China, works as the art director.
据策展团队介绍，本次双年展的主题为“摸着石头过河 ” ， 隐喻社会经济转型时期所采取的改革策略，也反映沙特社会文化发展的当下境遇。	According to the introduction from the planning team, the theme of the biennale is “crossing the river by feeling the stones”, which is a metaphor of the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period and reflects the current situations of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
本次双年展占地近12000平方米，展厅横跨六个相互连接的建筑，以六个单元呈现 ： 《 摸着石头过河 》 《 传承作为实验 》 《 边缘思考 》 《 走向公众 》 《 美丽新世界》以及《论艺术的精神 》 。	The biennale occupies an area of nearly twelve thousand square meters, and the exhibition hall stretches across six connected buildings with six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as an Experiment, Thinking at the Edge, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New Word and On the Spirit of Arts.
其中，27位沙特艺术家的作品数量占本次展品总量的四成以上，囊括绘画、装置艺术和表演艺术等多种形式；12位中国艺术家的作品同样备受关注，有的艺术家以新颖的方式使用回收材料进行创作，例如徐冰在《背后的故事系列之溪山无尽图 》 （ 2014）中，用废弃物重构了一幅经典山水画。	In which the number of the works of the 27 artists from Saudi Arabia accounts for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibits, including various art forms such as drawing, installation art and performing art; the works of the 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, and some artists create with recycled materials in an innovative way; for example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with wastes in Behind the Story Series, Picture of Endless Streams and Mountains (2014).
迪里耶双年展基金会首席执行官巴克利表示，希望本届双年展能够建立国际对话，让全球观众有机会了解沙特蓬勃发展的文化产业和创意社区，加强互动往来。	According to Buckley, CEO of Diriyah biennale foundation, it is hoped that the biennale can establish an international dialogue, provide global audiences with opportunities to understand the vigorously developed culture industry and innovative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactions.
田霏宇说 ： “ 双年展的目标是双重的，既能让沙特当代艺术参与全球对话，也能让沙特观众融入当代艺术世界 。 ”	Tian Feiyu said, “The biennale has two objectives, i.e., establishing dialogue between contemporary art of Saudi Arabia and the world, and integrating audiences of Saudi Arabia into the contemporary art world.”
据了解，在双年展开幕周期间还将举办系列讲座，艺术家、策展人和创意行业的意见领袖将就跨文化交流、当代艺术发展等主题展开讨论。	It is understood that there will be a series of lectures during the biennale, and artists, exhibition planners and leaders of innovative industries will engage in discussions on cross-cultural communication, contemporary art development and other topics.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网	Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhuanet
新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。	Message from Xinhua News Agency Kunming on December 12 (journalist: Lin Bifeng): In order to continue to provide assistance to the employment of people lifted out of poverty, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation work, Yunnan Province has released policies on the management of public welfare position in villages for promoting rural revitalization, as a way to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。	As introduced by person-in-charge of Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Yunnan, a total of 448.3 thousand rural public welfare positions have been developed in Yunnan to solve the employment of rural groups with difficulties such as labor force lifted out of poverty; they play an important role in helping people lifted out of poverty obtain employment and increase income, consolidating achievements of poverty relief and effectively improving rural public service abilities.
此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。	The new regulation is jointly printed and issued by seven departments such as the Department of Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization and Department of Finance of Yunnan, which mainly provides unified regulations on object scope, fund management, post development and post management of applicants of rural public welfare positions.
在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。	In terms of position development and setting, it is clearly stipulated in the new regulation that the positions are set according to the principles of “setting positions according to demands, designating personnel according to positions, dynamic management and total quantity control”, “the unit that develops and utilizes the positions shall be responsible for them” and “one position with one person, voluntariness, publicity and unified management”
招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。	The recruitment procedures must be conducted in accordance the steps of announcement, application, review, making public notice, employment, pre-job training and taking up the post.
此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。	In addition, the new regulation also specifies the specific duties of the main development department as well as the subsidy standard and method of the rural public welfare positions; it is stipulated that the development departments of rural public welfare positions shall purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for people taking rural public welfare positions; responsible departments are required to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare positions.
地址错了	The address is wrong.
你好	Hello,
可否取消订单	Can I cancel the order?
我重新下单	I will re-place the order.
是否已取消了	Is it canceled yet?
二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。	2. Although the Rightists had their time in history, it was not long, and the reason why it was short was they were over their head once they got a tiny bit of sweetness; a little success will lead to insatiable desires, and just one blow and they will lose their ground to exist.
但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。	But to speak the truth, the Rightists have once played a positive role in the process of social progress.
从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。	The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。	3. For me, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I really care about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is conscientious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.
但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。	But I oppose his anti-communist theory; I believe that unnecessary revolution should be opposed to; revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest and damage to people’s livelihood; political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will avail themselves of the opportunity to get in.
四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。	4. Changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude to be responsible for the country and the people; those who try to make money from political opportunities are not Rightists, but bastards.
再聊聊左。	Let’s talk about Leftists.
左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。	Leftists, in fact, are a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！	If the Rightists are of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Rightists’ remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, the Leftists don’t have such luck, because what the Leftists want is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。	5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the rebels and crazy Leftists at the same time, and they got really angry; I don't think it’s necessary at all.
跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。	Don’t try to reason with rebels and crazy Leftists; they are all one track minded and unreasonable.
也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？	Don’t try to prove we are right, and don’t even think about asking rebels and crazy Leftists to admit it; why bother?
我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！	I told my friends: when the rebels call you a fifty-cent and when the leftist call you a rightist dog, they prove we are on the correct track in the middle!
许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。	Many people had dreams when they were young, but they forgot about them when they got older; or, they pursue their dreams and become paranoid.
和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。	They drift apart from their dreams and the young Dragon Slayer will eventually become a vicious dragon.
左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。	I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom; the innate genes of China’s history and culture make China overall relatively left.
而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。	The domestic Rightists are free and stress efficiency and development, while the Leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。	At present, society overall hopes to pay more attention to justice; at the same time, it is certain that when China and the United States fight, it is bound to lean towards left, which is estimated to continue for many years.
虽然看不懂，点赞就完事儿啦	Just like it if you don’t understand.
啥也不说了，花花就是这么仗义	No need to say more, Huahua is generous.
近两年，美帝对华为芯片的封锁和围堵，不仅让华为陷入前所未有的困境，也让“美系”企业遭遇巨大的损失。	In the past two years, the blockade and interception of the US on Huawei chips not only made Huawei fall into an unprecedented difficult position but also made “American” enterprises suffer from huge losses.
美帝打压中国芯片产业，要求自家企业及盟友国相关企业同时对我国芯片产业进行封锁，直接导致的后果就是全球芯片供应商的订单和利润受到影响，造成芯片生产企业的研发投入降低、产能下降，从而造成了全球范围内芯片供应链的短缺的紊乱。	The US suppresses China’s chips industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises of its allies to block China’s chip industry at the same time; the direct consequence was that the number of orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in the decrease in the investment of research and development and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which further led to the disorder of chip supply chain shortages on a global scale.
如今“缺芯”已经波及到了全球各大行业，比如车企停产、手机涨价，几乎所有用到芯片的行业都深受其害。	Today, “lack of chips” has affected all major industries of the world, resulting in the suspension of production of car enterprises and rise in prices of mobile phones; almost all the industries using chips are greatly impacted.
为了掌握“芯片”自主权，越来越多国家的科技巨头开始走向“去美化”的道路。	To gain the right to make their own decisions on “chips”, more and more countries’ tech giants are taking the path of “de-Americanized”.
为了牢牢把控全球半导体控制权，牵制中国半导体行业的发展，最近老美动作频频，又是主持“芯片峰会”；又是邀请64国巨头成立半导体联盟，并拔款扶持美国本土科技巨头，比如，美帝老牌科技巨头英特尔为了夺回在芯片领域的主导地位，斥资200亿美元在美国亚利桑那州建2座晶圆加工厂，并对外开放芯片代工业务。	In order to firmly holding the right to control global semiconductor in its hands and pin down the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States have made frequent moves recently such as hosting the “chip summit”, inviting the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocating funds to support the local technology giants in the United States; in order to regain its leading position in the chip industry, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, US and opened its chip OEM business.
当大多数人都以为，英特尔此番举动将对台积电造成一定冲击，并很有可能抢走台积电的“饭碗”。	When most people think Intel’s move will make certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and even steal their job.
之所以这么肯定，是因为，英特尔作为美帝老牌科技巨头，在半导体领域深耕几十年，拥有大量的人才队伍和技术储备，必定能在短期内迅速崛起，打败台积电。	They are sure about it because Intel, as an old tech giant in the US, worked diligently in the semiconductor industry for dozens of years and have a large amount of talent teams and technological reserve; it is bound to rise within a short time and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
然而，对于英特尔的这个决定，台积电创始人张忠谋却不屑一顾。	However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, sniffed at the decision of Intel.
在今年四月举行的“2021大师智库论坛”上，张忠谋语出惊人，对于英特尔斥资建晶圆厂这个举动，张忠谋毫无顾忌直言：英特尔建芯片代工厂，相当讽刺。	At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark and spoke bluntly about Intel’s move to build a wafer factory, “it is rather ironic for Intel to build an OEM factory of chips”.
张忠谋之所以对英特尔进军晶圆领域颇为不屑，是因为张忠谋对30多年前台积电与英特尔的一段恩怨依然耿耿于怀。	Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel’s decision to get into the wafer industry because Zhang Zhong still holds a grudge against a feud between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel more than 30 years.
上世纪六七十年代，英特尔一直是美帝制造业中的明珠，雄居全球巅峰的位置，是世界半导体领域的霸主。	In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, occupying the leading position in the world; it was a king in the semiconductor industry in the world.
到上世纪80年代，世界半导体高端芯片一直被少数强者掌握。	Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been controlled by a few strong ones.
当时半导体行业以IDM模式为特征，芯片从设计、制造到封测都是由一家工厂来完成，英特尔就是那个时代的代表。	At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode; chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by the same factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
然而这样的模式让一些小企业不堪重负，很多半导体创业者面对巨额的产线建设费用只能望而却步。	However, such a model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs.
在市场需求的感召下，进入80年代后，芯片行业开始出现分工合作的现象，1984年张忠谋听说有专门做芯片设计的公司，便认为既然有专门做设计的，那么就可以成立一家专门用于晶圆制造的工厂。	To respond to the calling of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation of chips industry began to appear; in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
不久之后，张忠谋的设想变成了现实，台积电应运而生。	Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s imagination became reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was created.
台积电把主营业务瞄准了“晶圆加工”这个单一环节，不进行设计，只提供晶圆制造的代工服务。	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company aimed to set the single link of “processing of wafers” as its primary business; without design, only OEM services of wafer manufacturing was provided.
当时刚创立的台积电，在英特尔这个巨无霸面前就是小喽啰。	The newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was only a small player in front of Intel the giant.
为了获取资本支持，张忠谋就曾找英特尔投资，但当时英特尔一听说台积电只做芯片行业的制造环节，显然有些自视甚高，看不起台积电，果断拒绝对台积电进行投资。	In order to gain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but Intel was arrogant when it heard Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company only participated in the manufacturing of the chips industry; Intel looked down on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and resolutely refused to invest in it.
张忠谋也认定英特尔当时是看不起晶圆制程服务的。	Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel despised wafer manufacturing services at that time.
没想到当年看不起晶圆制造服务的巨头，如今却也要开始做晶圆代工。	Unexpectedly, the giant that looked down on wafer manufacturing services back in the days will also start to do wafer foundry now.
所以，张忠谋觉得英特尔进入晶圆代工很讽刺。	Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic for Intel to work on wafer foundry.
如今台积电的市值已经超过了英特尔。	The market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has surpassed that of Intel.
面对台积电的强势进攻，英特尔自然也是不敢固步自封。	Facing the powerful attack of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel naturally dares not to stand still.
如今，台积电已经向着3nm芯片冲刺，而英特尔仍然停留在7年前的14nm。	Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is trying to develop to the 3nm chips, and Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.
想要赶超其实并非易事。	It is actually not difficulty to surpass it.
不等了	I won’t wait any more.
到 19:06 就下单 2 小时了😅	It will be 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06😅
今天来看一些【奇怪的热搜】。	Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today.
什么是正常的舆情？	What is normal public opinion?
随机挑选三个热搜：二月二龙抬头、好丽友涨价、货拉拉事件，舆情扩散形成波峰，然后【指数下降】（平滑曲线）最终消散，如果产生次生舆情会有小驼峰再次出现。	Select three trending topics randomly, the rise of the head of the dragon on the 2nd of February, the price rise of ORLON, and the Huolala incident; the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the [index declined] to form a (smooth curve) until it finally dissipated; if a secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump again.
它们看起来和网信办官网曾展示的【网络舆情演化模型】相差无二。	They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] once displayed on the official website of Cyberspace Administration.
什么是异常的舆情？	What is abnormal public opinion?
随机挑选同一事件中的六个热搜，呈现出【孤峰状】、【锯齿状】、【断崖状】。	Randomly select three trending topics from the same event, there are [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].
【孤峰状】即人为加热，迅速冲榜热搜，引起大众关注；【锯齿状】即周期性加热，确保话题盘踞热搜榜单；【断崖状】即集体撤离，该热搜发挥完“功能”，接到新任务、冲向新战场。	[Solidary peak] means the topic is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the trending topics list and attracting public attention; [Zigzag] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that topic stays on the trending topics list; [Cliff] means collective evacuation; after the topic has played its “function”, they received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
图9中，一个事件的热度波峰恰好是另一事件的波谷，时间分秒不差，必定是统一批水军接到任务，开启新一轮攻势。	In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same; it must be because a unified batch of paid internet trolls have received the task and started a new round of offensive.
黑公关的专业化可见一斑：几十个热搜同时上榜，哪些吸引目光、哪些负责科普、哪些引战造势、哪些转移视线、哪些影响认知、哪些误导判断、哪些煽动情感、哪些裹挟决策，黑产账号分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到舆情传播扩散中的所有要素。	The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for explanation, which lead to argument and accumulate momentum, which divert attention, which affect understanding, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making; the black production accounts work in batches and conduct segmented operations in different batches and time nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
传播是一门科学，抛开立场、情感所有主观因素，仅从客观数据，黑公关也会无处遁形。	Communication is a science which disregards all subjective factors such as standpoint and emotion and only takes into account objective data; black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
凡走过必留下痕迹，这样的痕迹，我们一起挖出来。	Traces will be left from anyone walked by, and we can dig out these traces together.

大美360集成家装	Damei 360 Integrated Home Decoration
地 址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼	Address: Happy Home Building 12, South Ring Road 156
一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。	I trusted it because my friend made the recommendation, so I chose to check it out, and originally my budget for a basic decoration was 70,000.
来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。	A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store.
我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。	When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.
他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。	The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.
我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。	As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.
这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。	This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.
他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。	Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.
除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。	Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.
我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。	I’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.
当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。	When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.
无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。	Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.
各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。	They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.
坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。	Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.
所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。	So please don’t choose such a swindler company.
以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。	When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.
想要向商家提问，请先登录或注册	If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.
严禁发布各种形式的商家点评，详细请见商户收录声明	It is strictly prohibited to publish any type of merchant review, and please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.
大众点评昆明装修设计频道为您提供大美360集成家装地址，电话，营业时间等最新商户信息，找装修公司装修公司，就上大众点评	Dianping Kunming Renovation and Design Channel will provide you with the address, phone number, operation time and other information of Damei 360 Integrated Home Renovation, and please come to Dianping if you are looking for a renovation company.
这么恐怖，30 分钟内不到的话请取消订单！	It’s so horrible, and I will cancel the order if it doesn’t arrive in 30 minutes!
难道没有其他方法了吗？比如，换个地址？	Is there really no other way? For example, change the address?
好的，那你就别取消这个对话，如果 5 到 10 天没退我款，一定追究。	OK, then don’t cancel this conversation, and I’ll pursue it further if I don’t receive the refund in 5 to 10 days.
我问 15 分钟不到是不是可以取消	I asked if I could cancel it if it didn’t arrive in 15 minutes.

新华社天津12月12日电（记者周润健）天文科普专家介绍，作为本年度最后一场大规模流星雨，北半球三大流星雨之一的双子座流星雨将在12月14日迎来极大，喜欢流星雨的朋友可在当日后半夜进行观测。	Message from Xinhua News Agency Tianjin on December 12 (journalist: Zhou Runjian) According to introduction from astronomy science popularization expert, as the final large-scale meteor shower this year, the geminid meteor shower as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will be the maximum on December 14, and people who like meteor showers can observe during the latter half of the night on that day.

大部分流星雨的母天体都是周期彗星，但双子座流星雨的母天体却是3200号小行星法厄同，这是一颗阿波罗型小行星。	The parent object of most of the meteor showers are periodic comets; however, the parent object of the geminid meteor showers is Phaethon, No. 3200 asteroid, which is also an Apollo type asteroid.
双子座流星雨也是目前已知第二个不是由彗星“孕育”的流星雨。	The geminid meteor shower is the second known meteor shower that is not “bred” by comets so far.
天津市天文学会理事、天文科普专家修立鹏介绍说，就如贺岁大片一样，双子座流星雨一般在岁末出现 ， “ 上映档期”可以从12月4日持续到17日。	According to introduction from Xiu Lipeng, a member of the Council of Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert of astronomical science popularization, just like a new year blockbuster, geminid meteor shower generally occurs at the end of a year, with the “screening time” lasting from December 4 to December 17.
该流星雨以流量大且稳定著称，与象限仪流星雨、英仙座流星雨一起被称为北半球三大流星雨。	The geminid meteor shower is known for its ample flow and stabilization, which is called together with the Quadrantal meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere.
双子座流星雨的一个显著特点是流星体速度较慢，色彩丰富，火流星也不少，既适合目视，也适合天文摄影的初学者进行拍摄。	A significant characteristic of the geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroid, the abundant colors and the large number of fireballs, which is suitable for both visual observation and shooting by beginners of astronomical photography.

天文预报显示，今年的双子座流星雨将于12月14日15时左右迎来极大，极大时ZHR（在理想观测条件下，辐射点位于头顶正上方时，每小时能看到的流星数量）为150。	Based on astronomical forecast, the geminid meteor shower this year will be reach its maximum scale at about 15:00 on December 14, and the ZHR at the maximum (in the ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is right above the head, and the number of the meteors that can be seen every hour) is 150.

“去年 ， ‘ 落英缤纷’的双子座流星雨给人们留下了深刻印象，但今年的双子座流星雨会受到月光干扰，精彩程度会打一点折扣。	“Last year, people were impressed by the geminid meteor shower; however, the geminid meteor shower this year will be influenced by moon light, and its brilliance will be slightly influenced.
14日为农历十一月十一，月相为盈凸月，明亮的月光会对观测造成干扰，好在后半夜月亮就会落下，此时双子座流星雨的辐射点也会升得比较高。	December 14 is November 11 in Chinese calendar, with the moon in the gibbous phase; the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation; fortunately, the moon will go down in the latter half of the night, and the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower will rise higher.
喜欢流星雨的朋友可在后半夜月落后的这几个小时进行观测，但要注意防寒保暖 。 ”	People who like meteor showers can observe it in the hours after moon goes down in the latter half of the night, but remember to stay warm.”
如何才能尽可能地观测到更多的流星呢？	How to observe as many meteors as possible?
“不建议在城市进行观测，可以在郊区或是乡村选择一个海拔高、光害小、面向东北方向的视野开阔之处，然后耐心地等到月亮落下后，目视观测即可。	“It is not advised to observe meteor showers in the city; you may choose a place facing northeast and has high altitude, a wide view and little light pollution, and then you may observe with your eyes after the moon goes down.
需要注意的是，双子座流星雨朝各个方向的流量都很大，观测时不用一直盯着双子座流星雨的辐射点看。	It should be noted that the geminid meteor shower will have heavy flows on all directions, and you do not need to keep staring the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower.
喜欢摄影的朋友要想拍摄出绚丽的‘流星雨大片 ’ ， 最好选择广角、大光圈的镜头，拍摄时使用高ISO和最大光圈。	People who like photography can select wide angle lens and large aperture, and use high ISO and the maximum aperture while shooting if you want to take marvelous shots of the meteor shower.
基于稳定性和持续性考虑，三脚架、备用电池和快门线也必不可少 。 ”	Based on consideration of stability and sustainability, a tripod, a standby battery and a shutter release are also necessary.”
修立鹏提醒说。	Xiu Lipeng reminded.
激光电视和传统电视在市场定位上有何差异？	What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of the market positioning?
以我的理解，题主所说的传统电视应该指的就是液晶电视，而激光电视和液晶电视在市场定位上的差异，主要有以下两点：	In my understanding, traditional TV which the original post mentioned is LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in terms of market positioning are mainly the following two points:
第一，激光电视更聚焦大屏市场。	First, laser TV focuses more on big screen market.
相比液晶电视全面铺开的市场定位，激光电视显然更聚焦大屏市场，或者说激光电视本身就是为大屏而生的产物。	Compared with the all-round market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of big screen.
目前，主流液晶电视尺寸多在55英寸到65英寸，而激光电视的尺寸一般在75英寸以上，最大的超过100英寸，充分满足用户对大屏彩电的需求。	At present, the size of mainstream LCD TV is mainly from 55 to 65 inches, and the size of laser TV is usually over 75 inches, with bigger ones over 100 inches, which can satisfy the customers’ need for big screen TVs.
近年来，激光电视在全球的出货量和销量占比都在不断增加，在80英寸及以上总体电视销量中占比超六成。	In recent years, the proportion of the global shipments and sales of laser TV keeps increasing, accounting for over 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
根据中怡康的预测，2020年，激光电视市场销量增长将超过140%，继续保持高速增长。	According to the prediction of CMM, the sales volume of laser TV market in 2020 will increase by over 140% and will continue to maintain a high-speed growth.
之所以在大屏市场有如此好的成绩，主要归功于激光电视在护眼方面的出色表现。	The reason for such great result in the big screen market is mainly the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection .
基于激光电视漫反射的成像原理，激光光源发出的光线并不直射入眼球，相比液晶电视的背光源发光，成像过程更接近自然条件下物体的成像过程，对眼睛产生的刺激也更小。	Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not go directly into the eyeball; compared with the backlight of LCD TV, its imaging process is closer to that of objects under natural conditions, with less irritation to the eyes.
中国电子技术标准化研究院赛西实验室和北京协和医院眼科专家，通过人群相同条件下观看激光电视和液晶电视的严格对比试验，得出了144组测试数据。	Ophthalmologists from CES Laboratory, China Electronics Standardization Institute, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 groups of test data through a strict comparative experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
数据证实：激光电视的确具有很强的护眼特性，在特定方面甚至具有一定的改善作用。	Statistics prove that laser TVs can indeed protect the eyes and may even make improvement in certain aspects.
在视力健康越来越受重视的当下，激光电视不仅凭借护眼优势吸引了越来越多用户，也打开了彩电市场的另一个突破口。	As eye protection is gaining more and more attention, laser TVs not only attracted more and more customers with the feature of eye protection, but also made another breakthrough in the market of color TVs.
第二，激光电视更聚焦高端市场。	Second, laser TV focuses more on high-end market.
与液晶电视价格不断下探相反，目前市售激光电视的价格大多在万元以上，随着尺寸和光源的升级，价格逐步攀升。	Contrary to the downward trend of the price of LCD TVs, price of laser TVs on the market now is over 10,000 yuan, and it went up gradually with the upgrading of size and source of light.
激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？	Why are laser TVs so expensive?
肯定是有道理的。	There must be a reason.
在光源和技术水平的不断发展下，激光电视有很多液晶电视和投影都无法实现的优势。	With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TVs have advantages that many LCD TVs and projectors don’t.
凭借超短焦距投影技术，激光电视的投影距离相对传统投影设备来说要更短，能够在短距离内实现100英寸大屏体验，所需空间不大，而且主机小巧，占用地方很小。	With the super short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment; it can realize the 100 inch large screen experience within a short distance; the space required is not large, and the small host takes up very little space.
在亮度方面，大品牌激光电视可以达到2000以上的流明。	In terms of lightness, laser TVs from famous brands can reach over 2,000 lumens.
加之发热量更低，对设备损耗小，电视的使用寿命也更长。	Plus, the heat is lower, equipment loss is small, and the service life of TV is longer.
除此之外，很多高端激光电视机型还搭载了真4K超高清画质、人工智能系统、仿生屏等众多前沿技术，能够给用户带来更震撼的视听体验。	In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with real 4K ultra HD image, artificial intelligent systems, bionic screens and other cutting-edge technologies, bringing users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
谈不上伪需求，而是需求细分的产物，论画质和投入产出比，激光电视不是影音玩家的菜，想兼顾大屏和观看环境不足，可以尝试，凡事皆有利弊，权衡过后自己判断即可，就怕听信一面之词。	It's not so much of a fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation; when it comes to image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not what video and audio enthusiasts are after; if you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it; everything has its pros and cons, and you can make a decision yourself after deliberation; just don’t listen to only one side of the story.
简单说，超广角近焦投影机--激光电视，为了贴近幕布，不得不使用价格昂贵的超广角透镜和反射镜，这不符合光学最佳设计。	Simply put, in order to get close to the screen, ultra wide angle close focus projector, laser TV, has to use expensive ultra wide angle lens and reflector, which is not in line with the best optical design.
为了屏蔽部分环境光，使用微结构的菲涅尔幕布，代价高昂，80寸的价格基本能换个65寸液晶。	In order to shield part of the ambient light, it uses an expensive microstructure Fresnel screen; the price of an 80-inch laser TV basically can be changed into a 65-inch LCD TV.
还有一点，我特别讨厌投影厂商拿漫反射对眼睛好这种当卖点，拜托，眼睛能够看到的幕布上的光线对于眼睛而言就是直射光，你漫反射到天花板上，眼睛也看不到，非要较真液晶电视也是漫“直射”，打开电视天花板不也被照亮吗？	Another point is that I especially hate it when projector manufacturers using “diffuse reflection is good for the eyes” as a selling point; please, eyes can see the light on the screen means that it is direct light to the eyes; when it hit the ceiling, eyes cannot see it; if you want to be serious about it, then LCD TV also uses diffused “direct light”; isn’t the ceiling also illuminated when you turn on the TV?
而且，投影幕布如果不是漫反射，根本成不了像。	Moreover, if the projection screen does not use diffuse reflection, imaging is not possible at all.
恰恰被忽略了高增益幕布的热斑（光斑）效应，某一角度大量光线反射到眼睛，那才是真难受。	The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light at a certain angle being reflected into the eyes is really uncomfortable.
文摄视觉美学摄影馆优选品质店 暂时还没有分店	Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Premium Store has no branch store yet
加了微信预约日期，小姐姐就把可选择的时间安排发给我，回复信息比较及时~	I added their WeChat to make an appointment, then they sent me the available dates; their reply was speedy~
去之前看了店里的拍摄作品，更多的是户外婚纱，拍的很漂亮，涉及到的拍摄风格也很多。	I went to the store to see the photography works, and there were more beautiful outdoor wedding dress photos and a lot of different styles.
当天到了之后和小姐姐简单交流了自己的想法，非常耐心地帮我试了两套我纠结的风格衣服，最终敲定开始化妆造型~摄影师拍摄之前会摆一些道具，会指导动作，对各个细节也比较精益求精。	After I arrived that day, I communicated my own ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two outfits I was having trouble deciding and I made the final decision before starting styling and makeup~ the photographer would place some props and guide me to pose before the shoot, and was very attentive to the details.
但是可能因为没和我交流具体的拍摄想法，所以拍出来的不是我想要的风格，但是应该是好看的🙊🙊	However, the photos taken were not in the style I wanted, perhaps it was because they didn’t communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, but the photos should look nice🙊🙊
拍好之后摄影师会帮忙挑选照片，交流后期风格，感觉挺细心的叭。	After the shoot, the photographer would help pick the photos, communicate about post-editing style, and I think it was very thoughtful.
修好的片大约要半个月，坐等效果~	It will take about half a month to edit all the photos and I look forward to seeing them~
第二次中了写真类的霸王餐活动～全场大部分的衣服能够选择一件拍摄。	This is the second time that I have won the chance to experience a photoshoot for free~ you may choose one from most of the available outfits to do the photoshoot.
最后选择了一件黑色的纱裙，体验下不同的风格。	Eventually, I chose a black veil skirt so as to experience a different style.
整个拍摄过程要2个小时左右，化妆+拍摄，负责拍摄的摄影师是95后的弟弟呢，感觉稍微还是有点青涩，希望在顾客拍摄动作指导方面以后能给更多的建议呀～挺健谈的，拍摄过程比较愉快。	The entire photoshoot took about 2 hours including the makeup and shoot; the photographer was a young guy born after 1995, who seemed to be a little shy; I hope he could give more advice to clients in terms of poses~ he was talkative and the shoot was pleasant.

到店先填了姓名电话然后选服装，婚纱都可以选，换了三四套服装还蛮耐心的，选好后化妆化了很久，服务态度也好，后面拍摄会教你怎么摆造型，就是拍出来的感觉脸好大，精修说是要半个月，三四天就发来了，感觉好像跟原片没啥差别	After I arrived at the store, I filled in my name and chose the outfits; all the wedding dresses were available to be chosen; I tried on three or four outfits and they were quite patient; after I decided on the dress, they were doing my makeup for a long time and they were also nice during this time; later in the shoot, they would teach you how to pose; I felt my face was too big on the photo; they said detailed editing would take a month, but they sent them to me after three to four days, and they seemed not that different from the original photos.
【环境】整体还好。	[Environment] It was not bad overall.
可选衣服很多。	There are a lot of outfits to choose from.
化妆位置差不多有三个，里边是摄影棚。	There are about three seats for doing makeup and the studio is inside.
【服务】很热情，也很细心。	[Service] Very enthusiastic and attentive to details.
造型师挺有耐心的。	The stylist was patient.
摄影师也会很认真教你动作。	Photographer would patiently teach you to pose.
不满意，摄影师也会主动提出补拍。	If you are not satisfied, the photographer would propose to take it again.
【体验】可能造型有点过了，原本双眼皮被贴出了三眼皮。	[Experience] Maybe the style was a little too much, double eyelids turned into triple eyelids.
眉尾也被剃了，对于日常不画眉的有点尴尬。	The tail of my eyebrow got shaved, and it was a little awkward for those who don’t wear makeup normally.
照片十来天给了，但是P图效果不怎么满意，感觉双眼皮贴那些还是很明显。	The photos were sent to me after about ten days, but I was not very satisfied with the photoshop effect, and I feel that the double eyelids tapes are still obvious.
因为不太清楚要什么风格 试了两套 结果挑来挑去 还是选了黑色礼服 小姐姐说这套是比较赫本复古风	I tried on two outfits because I didn’t know what style to choose, and I ended up choosing the black suit after trying hesitating; the young lady said it was a vintage Audrey Hepburn style.
选好衣服后就开始弄妆发啦 发型师和化妆师小姐姐都超级耐心在帮我弄 弄出来的效果非常满意	After choosing the outfit, we began with the hair and makeup; the hair stylist and makeup artist were super patient and I was really satisfied.
弄好妆发后就开始拍照了 摄影师全程都有指挥我摆姿势 过程很轻松和谐	The photoshoot started after finishing makeup and hair, and the photographer guided me to pose the whole time; the process was relaxed and harmonious.
拍完后认真选了四张最喜欢的当精修 小哥哥说15内成片 结局非常心满意足～	After the photoshoot, I chose my four favorite ones to be retouched, and the guy said the photos would be completed within 15 days and I was really satisfied with the results~
已经 3 日没有回复……由于你们的系统无法识别出我的信用卡，因此我无法加入 #PRS_ORG# plus 月费计划！	There has been no replies for three days, and as your system cannot identify my credit card, I can’t join the#PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee project!
最奇怪的是，我每次付款使用的都是同一张信用卡	What is strange is that I paid with the same credit card every time.
我现在每次都要付运费	I have to pay the delivery fee every time now.
可以先豁免，到你们调查完再收取我的月费，这样行吗？	It can be exempted, and you can charge me with the monthly fee after the investigation, is that Okay?
小雨伞买保险，靠谱吗?	Is it safe to buy insurance on Little Umbrella?
小雨伞是一个互联网的保险经纪平台。	Little Umbrella is an insurance brokerage platform on the internet.
从设置条件来看：按照《保险经纪机构监管规定(2015年修订)》提示来看，成为保险经纪公司的，必须满足三个关键词：股东、发起人最近3年无重大违法记录、最低限额为人民币5000万元才可以成立、必须经过中国保监会同意。	In terms of setup conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (revised in 2015)", the following three key requirements must be met to become an insurance brokerage company, shareholders and initiator have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the CIRC.
这三条其实就是很苛刻的，总结起来就是要有实力，要经过银保监会（监管全国内的保险公司、银行）的国家权威部门批准、股东要有良好的作风，作为保险经纪公司的小雨伞保险，投保者是不用过多质疑小雨伞保险是正规的与否，毕竟有这3条门槛，不是什么保险公司都能达到的。	These three requirements are strict enough; in summary, it needs to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative departments of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and the shareholders’ conduct is descent; as an insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance doesn’t need to be questioned by policyholders about whether it is legal or not; after all, not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.
在这一点上，还不错，是值得信赖的。	In this regard, it is not bad and worth trusting.
从保险产品来看：小雨伞保险就是一个保险超市，很多公司的明星重疾险都在这家平台上出售，如最新上架的和泰超级玛丽5号重疾险，理赔方和承保方都是和泰人寿，小雨伞保险只是第三方中介，不用质疑它的靠谱性。	In terms of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, with star serious illness insurances of many companies on sale on this platform; for example, for the newly added HTLIC Super Mario 5 serious illness insurance, both the claim adjuster and the insurer are HTLIC, and Little Umbrella Insurance is only the third-party intermediary, whose reliability does not need to be questioned.
从缴费模式来看：互联网平台的产品，因为少了营业网点的经营费用，和业务员工资的成本，所以互联网产品普遍性价比比较高，而且缴费方式灵活，支持月缴，减轻投保人的缴费压力，同时可以最大限度的撬动保险的杠杆。	In terms of payment method: due to the lack of the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the sales people’s salaries, internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment; it reduces the payment pressure of the policyholder, and can leverage of the insurance lever to the greatest extent in the meantime.
这点还是非常不错的。	This is good.
可以考虑。	It can be considered.
从业务员专业度来看：这点尤为重要，因为保险是一个专业度要求非常强的行业，很多互联网产品客户可以自己投保，这种就会存在很多的误区，在健康告知和职业这块，非保险从业人员往往在投保的时候会添加自己的主观意识，觉得自己健康或者符合，这样容易存在很多理赔隐患，有可能被拒赔的风险。	In terms of the professional level of sales personnel: this is especially important as insurance industry has a strict requirement on expertise; for many internet products, customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings; in terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it; like this, there will be a lot of hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.
我自己曾在“腾讯微保”（和小雨伞一样，也是互联网保险经纪平台）做过保险电话销售，非常负责任的告诉大家。	I worked as insurance telemarketing personnel in “Tencent Micro-Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you.
互联网的保险是真的，也靠谱，不靠谱的是人，互联网渠道没有专业的从业人员，也有很多的销售误导。	The insurance products on the internet are real and reliable, and it is the people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners on the internet, and there is much misleading information in sales.
比如：1元保险保600万，买保险送手机，免费领取6万重疾保额，这些营销策略没有错，可是却避重就轻，不会告诉投保人，首月1元，次月是需要按正常收费的，几十到200不等，很多客户扣费一两年自己买的是个啥不清楚。	For example: there is nothing wrong with sales strategies like 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million yuan, buy insurance and get free mobile phones, and get 60,000 serious illness insurance coverage for free; however, they withhold important information and won't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the fee next month is charged normally, ranging from a few dozens to 200; many customers don’t know what they bought after they’ve been charged for one or two years.
以为可以花1块钱，保险公司赔600万（天下掉馅饼）。	They thought they could spend 1 yuan and get a six million claim settlement from the insurance company (pie in the sky).
免费送手机，是保单尾号比如6666，8888这种特殊保单号段才送的，并且如果中奖短信发出，自己不兑换，也没有人提醒的。	Getting mobile phone for free means only policy ending with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888 can get a free phone, and no one will remind you again if the text message is sent to you and you don’t redeem it yourself.
（这对于投保人来说，就又是一个坑）免费领6万重疾保额，是短期的，如果只靠这个，没有其他商业险，万一真发生重疾，6万能干嘛，解决不了问题，以后的生活开始裸奔。	(This is yet another trap for the policyholder) It is a short-term activity to claim 60000 serious disease insurance for free; if you only rely on this and there is no other commercial insurance, 60000 yuan will not solve any problem in case of the happening of a serious disease, and you will have nothing in your life later.
目前对于互联网保险销售的误导，国家也在严厉打击。	Our country is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales at present.
所以综合来看，平台是没有问题，产品也没有问题，有问题的是业务员的专业度和职业操守。	Therefore, there is no problem with the platform or the products; what matters is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesperson.
建议题主综合慎重考虑，其实很多线下保险经纪公司的产品更广，客户可以选择的机会和产品更多，有些产品的性价比也优于互联网产品。	It is suggested that the original post should think about it carefully; in fact, there are many offline insurance brokerage companies with a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from; some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
我自己就帮助过59位互联网客户，承保线下产品，保费每个人节约2000-3000元/年。	I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, helping each person save 2000-3000 yuan of premium per year.
如果大家有什么疑问，欢迎与我沟通和交流。	If you have any question, feel free to communicate with me.
我：明亚保险经纪人，有过3年企业管理培训经验，服务过近千家企业用户，合作超过100家保险公司，在投保前，我会从客户需求出发，为客户量身定制保险产品，投保中，为客户货比三家，尽力为客户争取最好的核保结果，投保后，为客户做保单整理，保单托管，让客户放心无忧。	I am a Mingya Insurance Broker and have three years of experience in enterprise management training; I have served almost a thousand enterprise users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I will analyze the needs of my client and customize products for them; while insuring, I will compare all the insurance companies and help my client achieve the best underwriting result; after insuring, I will organize and hold the insurance policy to make my client feel at ease.
跟每个客户一起终身成长。	Grow with each client for a lifetime.
希望我的回答能够对题主有所帮助！	Hopefully my answer will help the original post!
根据保险监管部门的定义，互联网保险就是投保人点击投保链接后，可以自主完成所有的投保流程的保险业务。	According to the definition of insurance supervising departments, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the applicant can complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking the insuring link.
在这个过程中，投保人不需要签字，保险顾问也不需要签字，所有步骤全部都可以由投保人自主完成。	In this process, neither the applicant nor the insurance consultant needs to sign, so all the steps can be fulfilled independently by the applicant.
虽然互联网保险的投保没太有“仪式感”，甚至可能连打印版的纸质合同都没有，但是这丝毫不影响电子版合同的有效性与法律效力。	Although insuring an Internet insurance product has no “sense of ritual”, and even there is no printed copy of contact, it doesn’t affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contract at all.
这种模式，有点类似于“电话销售”一般的流水线作业，但如此购买保险也会有一个致命的问题，那就是——后续的服务可能会跟不上。	This pattern is somewhat similar to assembly line operation of “telemarketing”, but buying insurance this way will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
保险通常是一份长达几十年的长期契约，我们在购买保险的时候，是不是应该认真思考一下，我们所选择的这个“中介”，是不是一个可以与我们长期相伴、在很多年后也会给我们提供服务的“保险中介人”呢？	Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades; when we buy insurance, shouldn’t we seriously consider whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
那我怎样才能联系到送餐专员	Then how can I contact the food delivery person?

没有问题，记得无须安排重送，我已另外购买，不想浪费	No problem, and remember not to arrange for a re-delivery, I have re-purchased it and I don’t want to cause any waste.
谢谢你帮忙	Thank you for your help.
从以前到现在，我都反对任何形式的污蔑和谩骂，更不能接受这类人身攻击的行为。	I have been against any form of insult or abuse since the beginning, and I will not stand such personal attacks.
在文明社会，我们可以包容一切，但就是要杜绝这种恶棍。	In this civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we need to get rid of these bullies.
如果不看政党和派系，要先抵制的，就是这种不文明的作风。	If you don’t look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized actions that should be boycotted first.
从你开始发来脸书加好友请求开始，进而发表具调侃性的帖子，再到你试图把所谓我的家地点和父亲名字发布在社交媒体上，我都已经采取不回应的态度。	I never replied to you since you started to send me Facebook friend request, published ridicule posts, and then tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father’s name on social media.
你过后变本加厉地不只按一日六餐的频率持续tag我，更在脸书跟你的所谓朋友们继续肆无忌惮地讨论着关于我一些隐晦、羞辱的言论，样貌、身材、好生养、又什么床上种草莓、要不要插之类的留言，我...也算了。	After that, you made it worse by not only continuing to tag me six times a day, but also continuing to wantonly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, figure, shape fit for giving birth, getting love bites in bed, whether to penetrate or not, I... forget it.
怎知后来我更收到多位朋友发来有关你的脸书朋友户口上载一张你的照片和具性骚扰成分的言论。	It was unexpected that more people sent me a photo uploaded to your Facebook friends page and your harassing comments.
抱歉，作为一位女生，我再也无法继续沉默了。	Sorry, I cannot be silent anymore as a girl.
我报警的新闻上载后，你完全没有收敛，反而更越发嚣张。	After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more arrogant.
我不理你是什么政治背景，也不管你是什么身份地位，在我们的社会，是需要两性尊重的。	I don’t care about your political background or your identity or position; in our society, the two genders shall respect each other.
是的，你们可以继续这种具调侃性、隐晦、羞辱、辱骂的言论，你也可以继续说你只是关爱和关注我，你可以继续认为这并不是骚扰、你甚至可以继续否认那不是你制的图或者继续发表一切攻击性言论。	Yes, you can continue with your ridicule, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks; you can continue to say that you just care about and pay attention to me; you can continue to think that this is not harassment; you can even continue to deny that you made the pictures or continue to make all the offensive remarks.
没错，我不能，也没有能力阻止你们。	Yes, I can’t and won’t stop you.
我既不认识你，也不想认识你，我的样貌和身材更不需要你评头论足。	I don’t know you and I don’t want to know you, and my appearance and body don’t need you judgement.
我甚至不认为会有哪一位女生愿意让别人如此地羞辱自己来换来出名。	I don’t even think any girl would want to be famous by being humiliated like this.
朋友问我，还好吗？	My friends asked me if I was okay.
我说好，你也不会信。	You won’t believe it if I say yes.
我觉得不会有任何一位女生被如此霸凌后还可以说自己还好。	I don’t think any girl could say they are okay after being bullied like this.
无论在工作、社会、政坛或商界，只有那些连基本品德都没有的人，才会选择用这种方式来伤害任何一位女性。	No matter it’s in the workplace, society, politics or the business world, only those without basic moral character will harm a woman in this way.
我相信，公道自在人心。	I believe justice is in everyone’s heart.
我截了部分留言给大家评理	I took screenshots of part of the comments and you can make your judgement.
你自己发的贴应该没有人可以冒充你了吧	You posted it yourself, and no one will pretend to be you, right?
我只能说你是文明的公敌	I can only say you’re the enemy of civilization.

（南海研究论坛） 美国海军在声明中称，俄亥俄级核潜艇“内华达号”此次对关岛的访问加强了美国和该地区盟友之间的合作，展示了美国的能力、灵活性、战备状态，以及对印太地区安全与稳定的持续承诺。	(South China Sea Research Forum) the U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine “Nevada” to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrated the ability, flexibility, combat readiness of the US, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
弹道导弹潜艇通常被称为“雷鸣潜艇”（Boomer submarine）。	Ballistic missile submarines are often called “Boomer submarines”.
美国海军舰队中14艘“雷鸣潜艇”的行踪通常是被严格保密的。	The whereabouts of the 14 “Boomer Submarines” in the US Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
围绕着弹道导弹潜艇的秘密使“雷鸣潜艇”成为“核三位一体中最重要的生存武器”，这一体系还包括位于美国本土的发射井弹道导弹，以及B-2和B-52等可携带核弹头的轰炸机。	The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes “Boomer Submarine" the “most important survival weapon in the Nuclear Trinity”; this system also includes launching silo ballistic missile located in the US, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
跟朋友聊起最近Meta大跌 26%，市值蒸发 2510 亿美元，扎克伯格回应「面临前所未有的竞争」，原因为何？	I talked to my friend about the recent 26% plunge in Meta and its loss of US $251 billion in market value; Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition”; why?
Meta（原 Facebook）实质是一家广告公司，收入主要来自于广告，今时今日赚钱的广告公司，自己是有流量渠道的。	Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue mainly comes from advertising; the advertising company that makes money today has its own channel for traffic.
Facebook，Instagram，Whatsapp 等等，无论什么样的功能定位，都是 Meta 的流量渠道。	Regardless of its function positioning, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all channels of traffic for Meta.
不仅如此，Meta 还是最大的”广告联盟”,很多 App 外接 Meta 的广告，通过 Meta 的广告平台是实现变现。	Not only that, Meta is also the biggest “advertisement alliance”; Many apps are externally connected to Meta’s advertising, and they achieve realization through Meta’s advertising platform.
但是，时代变了。	But, the time has changed.
第一，因为苹果隐私政策的调整，Meta 很难再拿到用户的数据信息，影响了广告投放的效率。	First, due to the adjustment of Apple’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users’ data information now, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
苹果现在的隐私政策对用户很友好，会很明显的提示用户是否允许 App 获取自己的信息，大多数人的正常反应肯定是不允许。	Apple’s current privacy policy is very user-friendly; it will use explicit prompt to ask users whether they allow apps to access their own information; most people’s normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
接下来如果 Google 再捅一刀，对 Meta 的收入影响还会更大。	If Google stabs again next, it will have a greater impact on Meta’s revenue.
第二，以前 Meta 的收入增长里的中国因素也弱化了（这个因素的比重不确定有多高，但确实存在）。	Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
大家平时都知道 Meta 在中国是没有业务的，但是这个理解并不准确。	We all know that Meta doesn’t have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
每年 Meta 至少10%的收入都来自中国，主要是中国做出海业务的公司贡献的。	At least 10% of Meta’s revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in offshore business.
Meta 在香港的办公室大概几百人，在大陆还有几大代理商。	There are around hundreds of staff at its Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.
中国公司想要拓展海外市场，Meta 都是绕不过的广告渠道，烧的钱大多都给了 Meta。	When Chinese companies want to expand overseas market, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and so most of the money is given to Meta.
有意思的是，现在字节的 TT 是 Meta 主要的竞争对手之一，但是前两年 Meta 从字节身上可赚到不少钱。	Interestingly, the TT of ByteDance now is one of Meta’s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
国内各个代理都在帮字节去 Meta 那里投广告，Meta 大中华区的业绩也很不错。	All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to do advertising at Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
最近我没有专门去了解，但是肯定不会比之前好。	I haven’t specifically learned about it recently, but it’s definitely not better than before.
中国公司在海外大规模烧钱的阶段已经过去了。	The stage when Chinese companies were burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
第三，新的流量渠道拓展不顺利。	Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook 越来越老了，新的包括 TT 在内的平台，都不在 Meta 手中。	Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT is not in the hands of Meta.
最大的问题不仅仅是收入下滑，而是缺乏增长预期。	The biggest problem is not the decline of revenue but lack of growth expectation.
资本市场不仅仅看中收入，更重要的是看未来的预期怎么样。	The capital market not only focuses on income; more importantly, it depends on future expectations.
很显然，Meta 的预期是不够的。	Obviously, the expectation for Meta is not enough.
为了给市场讲出新的故事，扎克伯格讲了 “元宇宙”.	In order to tell new stories to the market, Zuckerberg told the story about “Meta-universe”.
元宇宙确实应该是未来的方向之一，但是元宇宙的实现周期比较长，这个故事在这两三年应该不足以支撑起 Meta 的市值。	Meta-universe indeed should be one of the future directions, but the period of the realization of Meta-universe is long, and this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta.
所以未来这两年，应该是 Meta 比较艰难的时期。	Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
别看脸书现在非常的风光，每年也有1,000亿到2,000亿美元的收入，实际上脸书现在危机感非常强，跟其他的互联网企业和高科技公司相比，没有什么好的安全的护城河。	Although Facebook is very popular now with an annual income of US $100 billion to $200 billion; in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis; compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is not any good security moat.
虽然他的几款社交软件现在的日活比较高，也是主流的社交软件，比如Facebook，WhatsApp等等，但是面对tiktok的快速发展，脸书也没有什么信心，颠覆之间也就是眨眼的功夫。	Although the DAU of several of his social software is relatively high, and they are mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp; however, in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion could happen in the blink of an eye.
而搞元宇宙这个可望而不可及的概念，短时间之内完全没有成功的希望，因此脸书非常的危险，这也是为什么扎克伯格又是换公司的名字，又是不停的寻找新的赛道的根本原因，但是我觉得他的赛道选择是错的，是一条不归路 以上是我的一些思考，供参考。	The unattainable concept of meta universe has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is in danger; this is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his choice is wrong and there is no way back; the above is some of my thoughts for reference.
