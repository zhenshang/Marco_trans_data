The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.	绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.	原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.	于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end.	现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.	但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.	无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support.	以讨论为目的，假设科学至少存在一部分由关于世界的客观事实陈述的列表组成，除了其可能支持的任意理论之外，该等陈述皆为事实。
Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.	即使这些事实确实存在于科学之中，仍然有可能认为科学事实是纯理论的。
Scientific facts result from experiments.	科学事实源于实验。
The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered.	实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.	一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.	以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.	这 *并非* 一个支持客观科学事实存在的论点，我不相信这一论点。

The Domestic Partner and I went to the liquor store tonight for some beers and a bottle of bub.	我和我的同居伙伴今晚去酒类专卖店买了些啤酒和一瓶起泡酒。
When we went to check out, the cashier is a fairly obvious #trans woman.	我们去结账的时候，发现收银员明显是一位#跨性别女性。

And then we just... paid for our stuff.	然后我们就...为我们买的商品结了账。
And said thank you.	还说了谢谢。

This is the stupidest timeline and I hate it dot com.	这次经历真蠢，我再也不想遇到它。
Nothing stops Donald Trump from running for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell.	谁都阻止不了唐纳德·特朗普在被起诉时、被定罪后，甚至是在监狱里竞选总统。
If elected, he would undoubtedly pardon himself to get out of prison.	如果成功当选，毫无疑问，他会大赦自己离开监狱。
But he can't pardon himself out of state prison.	而他无法大赦自己离开州立监狱。
It takes the state's governor.	因为这一点需要州长同意。
The two states involved are New York and Georgia.	可以做到这一点的两个州就是纽约州和乔治亚州。
The latter's Governor Kemp will undoubtedly pardon Trump if convicted or even indicted by Fulton County DA Fannie Willis.	如果被富尔顿县地方检察官法尼·威利斯定罪或甚至起诉，乔治亚州州长肯普无疑会赦免特朗普。
NY is the best hope for accountability	纽约州肩负着问责的最大希望
There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning.	大量证据表明，现实世界的通信不能简单认定为发送与背景毫无关联的信号。
In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario.	在本研究中，我们以一个经典的刘易斯（1969）信号模型的变体为基础，对在一个情境场景中出现依赖背景的通信的条件进行了探索。
In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence.	特别地，我们通过证据证实，对于此现象的出现，最小化词汇量的压力就已足够。
At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings.	与此同时，环境条件和认知能力在符号意义方面使语境出现歧义，我们对此进行了研究。
We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end.	我们发现，接收者选择所指对象的环境限制可以被发送者单方面利用，而接收者没有消除歧义的能力。
Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication.	与通常假设一致，发送者对语境的意识似乎是语境通信的必需条件。
We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts.	我们认为，依赖语境的通信是一种情景化的多层次现象，受到环境属性如语境分布的重要影响。
The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy.	此研究中开发的模型表明，信号在脱离语境的情况下可能是模糊的，但仍然为几近完美的通信精度提供了条件。
I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress.	周末真的很开心，与来自 Ashanti Development 的 Penny 和 Nicholas 讨论了一下他们的进展。
Ashanti Development has been working with an ever-expanding number of communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana for approaching 20 years, engaging with communities and providing support with water and sanitation, education, healthcare, tree planting and farming.	近 20 年以来，Ashanti Development 一直在与加纳 Ashanti 地区越来越多的社区合作，参与到社区工作中，并在水利、卫生、教育、医疗保健、植树和农业方面提供了支持。

The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night.	第二天早上，对于克里斯·利希特昨晚在美国有线电视新闻网伪装不光彩的公共服务新闻，我无法忘记。

Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean.	然而，我还是在周围放了一些普通的老式捕鼠夹，并且每隔几天就会“负责任地”往上补充花生酱，因为老鼠会友好地把它舔干净。
I finally got fed up with this routine last night, cleaned all the traps of peanut butter, and superglued a pistachio to them.	昨晚我终于放弃了这种套路，把所有花生酱都清理了，还用强力胶粘了一颗开心果在上面。
It worked.	奏效了。
(fwiw, I've tried nearly every "humane" trap on the market with very little success.	（顺便说一句，我几乎试过了市场上所有的“人道”陷阱，但收效甚微。
I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)	我并不会为了杀死它们乐此不疲，而我也不会对杀死老鼠的道德问题发表意见。）

I gripe about dad-ification a lot.	我多父亲化这种行为非常抵制。
Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:	以下是关于我所说的“父亲化”的简单概述（略长）：
It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger).	这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。
The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.	《最后生还者》是一个关于父亲化的经典示例。
Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as "caring."	Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。
Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic.	父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has.	父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success.	这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。

Guess I'll have to see whether Bing or Google is better at translating dirty gay sex puns.	我想我得看看必应和谷歌谁更擅长翻译下流的同性恋性爱双关语。
Been toying with this thought for a little while:	考虑这个想法已经有一段时间了：
Mental health is often seen as something separate from "regular" health.	与“普通”健康相比，心理健康通常被视为异类。
Why?	为什么？
Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health.	因为它针对的是大脑，似乎不像身体健康那样看得见摸得着。
In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot.	事实上，你的精神健康，你的大脑健康，就像你的腿脚健康一样，同样是健康问题。
Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible.	双性人竟然被 TERF 之类的机构所认可，因为它通常更具物理性，因此也更明显。
In the same way that mental health is seen as less "real" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind.	就像许多人认为精神健康不如身体健康“真实”一样，我有点觉得跨性别只是精神上的双性人。
The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of "My sex is male, my gender is female" seems simplistic and inaccurate.	我读的关于性、性别、心理学的研究越多，“我的性是男，我的性别是女”的说法就越显得简单化和不准确。
It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.	这大概就像把论点的一部分让给了 TERF。
I feel that to be trans is to be "biologically non-binary".	我觉得跨性别就是“生物非二元”。
My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.	我的性是非二元的，我的性别是女。
I think the designation of "non-binary" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex.	我认为“非二元”的定义需要从仅仅是一个性别术语扩展到对性的指代。

Police arrest 15 after violent protest outside UK refugee hotel	在英国的难民旅馆外的暴力抗议结束后，警察逮捕了 15 人
The incident comes after increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the Channel to the UK in boats.	在越来越多的难民和寻求庇护者乘船穿越英吉利海峡前往英国之后，发生了这一事件。
Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers turned violent near the English city of Liverpool.	在英国城市利物浦附近，一家用于收容寻求庇护者的酒店外的反难民示威演变成暴力冲突后，警方逮捕了 15 人。
The Merseyside Police department said a police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday night in Knowsley.	默西塞德郡警察局表示，周五晚上，在诺斯利的骚乱中，一名警察和两名平民受了轻伤。
The police force said some protesters threw objects and set a police van on fire.	警方表示，一些抗议者投掷物品，并点燃了一辆警车。
The people arrested, who ranged in age from 13 to 54, were detained "following violent disorder."	被捕的人年龄从 13 岁到 54 岁不等，“在暴力骚乱后”被拘留。
Merseyside police commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a couple of injuries amongst the police officers."	默西塞德郡警察局长 Emily Spurrell 告诉 Radio City，“当时非常危险，有几名警察受伤。”
The Home Office has been using the hotel to temporarily house asylum seekers since last year, according to local media.	据当地媒体报道，自去年以来，内政部一直在这家酒店临时安置寻求庇护者。
George Howarth, who represents Knowsley in the UK Parliament, said the violence on Friday night did not reflect the community.	在英国议会代表 Knowsley 的 George Howarth 表示，周五晚上的暴力事件并没有反映出社区的情况。
"The people of Knowsley are not bigots and are welcoming to people escaping from some of the most dangerous places in the world in search of a place of safety," he said.	他说：“诺思利的人们并不偏执，他们欢迎人们逃离世界上最危险的地方，寻找一个安全的地方。”
"Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community."	“在今晚的抗议活动中，那些反对难民的人并不代表这个社区。”
The protest took place amid heightened tensions as growing numbers of refugees and migrants cross the Channel in small boats.	随着越来越多的难民和移民乘坐小船穿越英吉利海峡，紧张局势加剧，抗议活动随之发生。
More than 45,000 people reached the UK by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum.	2022 年，超过 4.5 万人通过这条路线抵达英国，大多数人申请了庇护。
The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many asylum seekers stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodations.	由于政治动荡和官僚主义的拖延，庇护申请系统非常缓慢，令许多寻求庇护者被迫困在酒店或其他临时住所。
The Channel crossings have become a political issue, with the Conservative government promising to "stop the boats" and pursuing a plan to send such asylum seekers to Rwanda.	横渡英吉利海峡已经成为一个政治问题，保守党政府承诺会“阻止船只”，并推行一项计划，将这些寻求庇护者送往卢旺达。
Opponents have accused the government of demonising desperate people fleeing war and poverty.	反对者指责政府将逃离战争和贫困且绝望的人们妖魔化。

DHS hires law firm to handle possible Alejandro Mayorkas impeachment proceedings	DHS 聘请律师事务所处理 Alejandro Mayorkas 可能面临的弹劾程序
The Department of Homeland Security has hired an outside law firm - Debevoise & Plimpton - to assist in possible impeachment proceedings for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, as he potentially faces charges by House Republicans regarding his handling of the southern border.	国土安全部已经聘请了一家外部律师事务所 Debevoise & Plimpton 协助 Alejandro Mayorkas 可能面临的弹劾程序，因为他可能面临众议院共和党人指控他处理南部边境的问题。
"The Department of Homeland Security has retained outside counsel to help ensure the Department's vital mission is not interrupted by the unprecedented, unjustified, and partisan impeachment efforts by some Members of Congress, who have already taken steps to initiate proceedings," a DHS spokesperson said in a statement Friday.	DHS 发言人周五在一份声明中说：“国土安全部聘请了外部律师，以帮助确保该部的重要使命不会因一些国会议员前所未有的、不合理的和党派性的弹劾而中断，这些议员已经采取措施启动诉讼程序，”

I think that's our responsibility."	Mayorkas 尚未对这一事态发展发表评论，但被问及上周四的弹劾质询时，他告诉记者，“我们将与本届国会合作，如同与上届国会合作。我认为这是我们的责任。”
He conceded that "it will take time" to comply with the House's investigation.	他承认，配合众议院的调查“需要时间”。

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a bear-y unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch.	明尼苏达自然资源部前来解救一只不幸被困在沟里的熊。
The bear had hunkered down in a culvert alongside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department.	根据该部门在 Facebook 上发布的帖子，这只熊曾被困在明尼苏达州 Wannaska 附近路边的一个涵洞里。
But when the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, according to the department.	据该部门称，当雪开始融化时，涵洞开始泛滥，将熊困在深深的冰雪中。
Staff from the department quickly responded to the scene and helped remove the bear.	该部门的工作人员迅速赶到现场，帮助移走了这只熊。
The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and pronounced him healthy but groggy - obviously, because he'd been woken up from his winter sleep," according to the Facebook post.	根据 Facebook 帖子，该部门的熊生物学家 Andrew Tri“检查了这只熊并表示，它很健康，但有点虚弱——显然，由于它刚从冬眠中醒来”。
The department then relocated the bear to a state sanctuary to resume his hibernation.	该部门随后将这只熊转移到一个州立保护区，让它继续冬眠。
The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.	这只昏昏欲睡的食肉动物估计有 6 岁龄，体重在 375 到 400 磅之间。
The department reminded residents that moving bears is a job best left to the professionals.	该部门提醒居民，转移熊的位置最好留给专业人士完成。
If you're worried about a bear in your neighborhood, you should contact local authorities - not try to move or feed the sleeping giant.	如果你担心你的邻居家有熊，你应该联系当地政府——而不是试图转移或喂养此类冬眠中的巨型动物。
In this case, bystanders first tried to dig out the bear by themselves and offered him food, including Pop-Tarts, lettuce and Fancy Feast cat food.	在这种情况下，旁观者首先试图自己挖出这只熊，并给他提供食物，包括馅饼、生菜和精美的猫食。
But, luckily for the well-intentioned diggers, "because bears don't have the desire to eat in the winter, the bear didn't bite."	但是，对于好心的挖掘者来说，幸运的是，“因为熊在冬天没有进食的欲望，所以熊没有咬人。”
Minnesota is home to between 12,000 and 15,000 black bears, found mainly in the northern third of the state, according to the Department of Natural Resources.	根据自然资源部的数据，明尼苏达州有 12000 至 15000 只黑熊，主要分布在该州北部三分之一的地区。
The predators hibernate for as long as six or seven months in the winter, during which time they do not eat and live off of their stored body fat.	此类熊在冬天冬眠长达六到七个月，在此期间，它们不进食，靠储存在体内的脂肪为生。

Waziri added that Djehuty was supervisor of the state treasury and overviewed works of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.	Waziri 补充说，Djehuty 在哈特谢普苏特女王统治期间是国库的主管，负责审查工匠和艺术家的作品。

Jared O'Mara should never have been a Labour candidate, says Rachel Reeves	Rachel Reeves 表示，Jared O'Mara 本来就不应该成为工党候选人
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year jail sentence, the shadow chancellor has said.	影子内阁财政大臣说，名誉扫地的前议员 Jared O'Mara“本不应该被选为工党候选人”，他应该被判四年监禁。
Rachel Reeves was talking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party quit in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.	Rachel Reeves 周五在博尔顿东北选区接受《卫报》采访，几个小时前，当地政党的关键人物辞职，以抗议工党全国执行委员会（NEC）如何控制下届大选的议会选举过程。
The entire selection committee in Bolton North East resigned after they were not allowed to choose the shortlist, an increasingly common practice in Keir Starmer's Labour party, saying: "Yet again, it appears that the Labour party is seeking to promote the views and attitudes of a clique in London, rather than local members in the north."	博尔顿东北部的整个遴选委员会在不允许他们选择候选名单后辞职，这在凯尔·斯塔默的工党中越来越常见，他们说：“然而，工党似乎又一次试图宣扬伦敦某个小集团的观点和态度，而不是北方当地议员的观点和态度。”
They added: "This goes against the attitude necessary to win back the red wall, which is so desperately needed to deliver a Labour government."	他们补充道：“这与赢回红墙所需的态度背道而驰，而红墙是组建工党政府所迫切需要的。”
Reeves said: "I don't know what the circumstances are of what has happened in Bolton, but I do know that those being selected are strong candidates, often with very strong roots in their communities."	Reeves 表示：“我不知道博尔顿的情况如何，但我知道那些被选中的人都是强有力的候选人，他们通常在自己的社区有着非常牢固的根基。”
There has been particular unhappiness that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and aide to the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, was not longlisted to try to win the seat back from the Conservatives, despite garnering nominations from four big trade unions.	尤其令人懊恼的是，尽管西北工党主席兼支持 Jeremy Corbyn 的沃灵顿北议员 Charlotte Nichols 的助手 Leigh Drennan 获得了四大工会的提名，但没有尽力从保守党手中夺回席位。
Reeves said she had nothing to do with candidate selection, but added: "I do know that it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be longlisted and who can be shortlisted."	Reeves 表示她与候选人的选择无关，但补充道：“我明确知悉，我们有严格的流程来决定谁能入围，谁能被列入候选名单，这真的很重要。”
O'Mara was imprisoned for four years this week after a jury found he had submitted fake expense claims totalling £52,000 in an attempt to fund his cocaine and alcohol abuse.	本周，O'Mara 在陪审团发现他提交了总计 5.2 万英镑的虚假费用报销申请，试图为他的可卡因和酒精滥用提供资金后，被监禁四年。
Many people have suggested he was not properly vetted by Labour when he was selected to fight Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, in Sheffield Hallam in 2017"s snap general election.	许多人认为，在 2017 年的谢菲尔德哈拉姆大选中，他被选中与前自由民主党副首相 Nick Clegg 竞争时，没有经过工党的适当审查。
Asked if the O'Mara debacle was looming large in the minds of Labour's NEC, Reeves said: "I don't want to suggest in any way that anyone not on a shortlist is a cocaine user.	当被问及工党全国选举委员会是否对奥玛拉的惨败忧心忡忡时，Reeves 说：“我不想以任何方式暗示，在候选名单之外的人都使用可卡因。
But Jared O'Mara was a terrible case.	但是 Jared O'Mara 是个可怕的例子。
He should never have been selected as a Labour candidate; he should never have been an MP.	他本不该被选为工党候选人，也不该成为一名议员。
He used public money, it's absolutely right he's received his sentence."	他用的是公款，他被判刑是理所应当的。”
The O'Mara circumstances were "pretty exceptional," said Reeves, but she acknowledged: "There are important lessons to be learned for the Labour party and all political parties on the selection of candidates.	Reeves 表示，O'Mara 的情况“非常特殊”，但她也承认：“对于工党和所有政党来说，在挑选候选人方面都有重要的经验教训要吸取。
But I would also say, in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards falling well short of what you could expect."	但我也要说，在这个议会中，我们看到了政治标准的不断削弱，不仅仅是一连串的总理和罚款，政党和标准远远低于你所能期望的。”
She added: ""One thing I would say about the Labour party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that's just not the case in the Conservative party."	她补充道：“关于工党，我想说的一点是，当人们做错事时，他们会丢掉鞭子。而保守党就不是这样了。”

Reeves was in Bolton to meet apprentices at a training centre for Openreach, which provides the UK's broadband network.	Reeves 在博尔顿会见了 Openreach 培训中心的学徒，该公司在英国提供宽带网络。
After watching apprentices climb up pretend telegraph poles at the £1.7m site, Reeves discussed Labour's plans to overhaul the apprenticeship levy, which forces larger firms to put aside 0.5% of their payroll to fund apprentices.	在观看了学徒爬上 170 万英镑工地上的模拟电线杆后，Reeves 对工党改革学徒税的计划进行了讨论，该计划迫使大公司拿出工资的 0.5% 来资助学徒。
Businesses complain the levy is too inflexible. For example, said Reeves, Openreach "wants to retrain people who work on copper to work on fibre, but the apprenticeship levy doesn't have that flexibility around retraining."	企业抱怨税收规定太过死板。例如，Reeves 表示，Openreach“希望对从事铜加工的人进行再培训，让他们从事纤维加工，但学徒税在再培训方面没有这种灵活性。”
Reeves said Labour would change the levy so companies could use the money to retrain employees in industries such as the automotive sector and those currently fitting gas boilers.	Reeves 表示，工党将改变税收，这样公司就可以用这笔钱对汽车行业和目前安装燃气锅炉的行业的员工进行再培训。
"We need them as part of the energy transition to net zero to be learning the skills to work on electric vehicles or fitting heat pumps or hydrogen boilers.	“我们需要他们作为能源零净转换的一部分，学习电动汽车或安装热泵或氢锅炉的技能。
We want those people to be retrained to get the skills that they need to succeed.	我们希望这些人接受再培训，获得成功所需的技能。
And yet the apprenticeship levy is stacked up against them.	然而学徒税对他们不利。
Businesses want greater flexibility and young people starting off in life or older people who want to retrain to make sure that their skills are relevant for the future," said Reeves.	Reeves 表示，企业希望有更大的灵活性，年轻人希望开始新的生活，老年人希望接受再培训，以确保他们的技能可以在未来工作中适用。”
One arrested amid Tate Britain protest over drag queen children's event	一人在泰特英国抗议变装皇后儿童活动中被捕
One person has been arrested amid a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytelling event for children was being hosted.	一人在泰特英国美术馆外的抗议中被捕，彼时那里正在举办一场变装皇后为儿童讲故事的活动。
The Metropolitan police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment towards a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster.	伦敦警察厅表示，一人因涉嫌在威斯敏斯特附近的美术馆外对一名警察发表种族主义言论而被捕。

Officers had to form a corridor so attenders could get into the venue.	官员们不得不形成一条走廊，以便与会者能够进入会场。
Writing on Twitter, the drag queen said the day had been "proper emotional," adding that five protesters had gained entry to the Tate and "caused a disruption" in parts of the building, but they did not affect the readings.	这位变装皇后在推特上写道，这一天是“适当的情绪化”，并补充说，五名抗议者进入了泰特美术馆，并在建筑的部分区域“造成了混乱”，但他们没有影响讲故事活动。

The Drag Queen had said that "risk assessments" had taken place beforehand - but added it was "ridiculous" that they were necessary.	这位变装皇后曾表示事先进行了“风险评估”，但补充道被要求进行评估是“荒谬的”。
Aida tweeted: "5 haters made it into the Tate. They caused a disruption. BUT not to Drag Story Hour UK ...They made a fuss elsewhere in the building, not where the show was!! SHOW 2 went swimmingly!!!"	Aida 在推特上写道：“5 个仇恨者进入了泰特美术馆。他们制造混乱。但不是针对英国变装故事时间...他们在大楼的其他地方大惊小怪，而不是演出的地方！！第二场演出进行得很顺利！！！”
Aida had been staging three storytelling sessions on Saturday at 11am, noon and 2pm.	Aida 已经在周六上午 11 点、中午和下午 2 点举行了三场讲故事会。

Trump's Prized 40 Wall Street Building On 'Lender Watch' Amid Dropping Income: Report	在收入下降的情况下，特朗普在“贷款人观察”中珍视的华尔街 40 号大楼：报告
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on "lender watch" amid plummeting income and increasing costs, Bloomberg reported Friday.	据彭博社上周五报道，唐纳德·特朗普位于华尔街 40 号的巨额抵押摩天大楼由于收入骤降，成本上升，正处于“贷款人观察”之中。
The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to almost 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported.	据彭博社报道，根据该建筑剩余的 1.265 亿美元抵押贷款的月度文件，这座 72 层建筑（特朗普最有价值的建筑）的空置率在去年第三季度跃升至近 18%。
Expenses, meanwhile, have reportedly risen 11% since the origin of the 2015 mortgage.	与此同时，据报道，自 2015 年抵押贷款发放以来，支出增加了 11%。
Trump has often bragged about the building he acquired in 1995, which was appraised at $540 million in 2015.	特朗普经常吹嘘他在 1995 年获得的大楼，该大楼在 2015 年被估价为 5.4 亿美元。
The day of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, a Trump bragged in a TV interview that 40 Wall Street was suddenly the tallest building in the city.	2001 年 9 月 11 日，恐怖袭击摧毁了世界贸易中心，造成 3000 人死亡，特朗普在一次电视采访中吹嘘道，华尔街 40 号突然成为这座城市最高的建筑。

Wagner owner says war in Ukraine will drag on for years	瓦格纳老板称乌克兰战争将持续数年
The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years.	积极参与乌克兰战斗的俄罗斯瓦格纳集团私人军事承包商老板预测，这场战争可能会持续多年。
Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas.	Yevgeny Prigozhin 在周五晚些时候发布的视频采访中表示，俄罗斯可能需要 18 个月到两年的时间才能完全控制乌克兰东部工业中心顿巴斯。
He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.	他补充道，倘若莫斯科决定占领第聂伯河以东更多领土，战争可能会持续三年。
The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed "Putin's chef" for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.	Prigozhin 是一名百万富翁，与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京关系密切，因其利润丰厚的克里姆林宫餐饮合同而被称为“普京的厨师”，他的声明标志着克里姆林宫认识到了竞选中面临的困难。在俄罗斯军队于 2 月 24 日入侵乌克兰时，最初预计竞选将在几周内结束。
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south.	到了秋天，乌克兰军方成功发起反攻，收复了东部和南部的大片领土，俄罗斯因此遭受了一系列屈辱性的挫折。
The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the "special military operation" will continue until its goals are fulfilled.	克里姆林宫没有预测战斗的持续时间，称其所谓的“特别军事行动”将持续到目标实现。
The Russian forces have focused on Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.	俄罗斯军队一直专注于乌克兰的卢甘斯克和顿涅茨克省，这两个省组成了顿巴斯地区，自 2014 年以来，莫斯科支持的独立主义分子一直在该地区与乌克兰军队作战。
Prigozhin said that the Wagner Group mercenaries were continuing fierce battles for control of the Ukrainian stronghold of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.	Prigozhin 说，瓦格纳集团雇佣军正在继续激烈战斗，以控制顿涅茨克地区的乌克兰据点 Bakhmut。
He acknowledged that the Ukrainian troops were mounting fierce resistance.	他承认乌克兰军队正在进行激烈的抵抗。
As Russian troops have pushed their attacks in the Donbas, Moscow has also sought to demoralize Ukrainians by leaving them without heat and water in the bitter winter.	随着俄罗斯军队在顿巴斯推进他们的攻击，莫斯科也试图通过让乌克兰人在严冬环境中缺乏暖气和水源以打击其士气。
On Friday, Russia launched the 14th round of massive strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other vital infrastructure.	周五，俄罗斯对乌克兰能源设施和其他重要基础设施发动了第 14 轮大规模袭击。
High-voltage infrastructure facilities were hit in the eastern, western and southern regions, resulting in power outages in some areas.	东部、西部和南部地区的高压基础设施遭到袭击，导致一些地区停电。
Ukraine's energy company, Ukrenergo, said Saturday that the situation was "difficult but controllable," adding that involved backups to keep up power supplies but noting that power rationing will continue in some areas.	乌克兰能源公司 Ukrenergo 周六表示，情况“困难但可控”，并补充道，此情况下，需要备用以保持电力供应，但指出在一些地区将继续实行限电。
Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that Russian forces launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones between late Thursday and midday Friday, adding that Ukrainian air defenses downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones.	乌克兰最高军事长官将军Valerii Zaluzhnyi 表示，俄罗斯军队在周四晚些时候至周五中午期间发射了 71 枚巡航导弹，35 枚 S-300 导弹和 7 架 Shahed 无人机，并补充说，乌克兰防空部队击落了 61 枚巡航导弹和 5 架无人机。
The Ukrainian authorities reported more attacks by killer drones later on Friday.	乌克兰当局报告称，周五晚些时候，杀手无人机发动了更多袭击。
The Ukrainian air force said the military downed 20 Shahed drones in the evening.	乌克兰空军表示，军方在晚上击落了 20 架 Shahed 无人机。
Late Friday, Russian military bloggers and some Ukrainian news outlets posted a video showing an attack by a sea drone on a strategic railway bridge in the Odesa region.	周五晚些时候，俄罗斯军事博客和一些乌克兰新闻媒体发布了一段视频，显示一架海上无人机袭击了奥德萨地区一座具有战略意义的铁路桥。
The grainy video showed a fast-moving object approaching the bridge in Zatoka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Odesa, and exploding in a powerful blast.	这段像素较低的视频显示，一个快速移动的物体接近位于敖德萨西南约 50 公里（30 英里）的扎托卡大桥后，卷入强大的爆炸中。
The authenticity of the video couldn't be verified.	该视频的真实性无法得到证实。
The Ukrainian military hasn't commented on the attack, and Serhii Bratchuk, a spokesman for the regional administration, wouldn't confirm the drone attack when he spoke in televised remarks on Saturday.	乌克兰军方尚未对袭击发表评论，地区行政当局发言人 Serhii Bratchuk 周六在电视讲话中也没有证实无人机袭击。
The bridge, which was targeted by Russian missile strikes early in the war, serves the railway link to Romania, which is a key conduit for Western arms supplies.	这座桥在战争早期成为俄罗斯导弹袭击的目标，它服务于通往罗马尼亚的铁路，是西方武器供应的重要通道。

On Friday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office cleared Kilcher, 32, of all charges in a workers" compensation fraud case.	周五，洛杉矶县地方检察官办公室撤销了对 32 岁的基尔彻在一起工人赔偿欺诈案中的所有指控。

Balenciaga boss calls holiday campaign 'stupid mistake'	巴黎世家老板称假日活动为“愚蠢的错误”
Luxury clothing brand Balenciaga is still reeling from the backlash over two of its recent ad campaigns.	奢侈服装品牌巴黎世家最近的两次广告活动仍受到强烈反对。
Months after the fashion house came under heat for promotional images that critics said sexualized children, Balenciaga artistic director Demna (full name Demna Gvasalia) said he's still sorry for the images in an interview with Vogue published Friday.	几个月前，巴黎世家的宣传图片遭到批评，称这些图片将儿童色情化。几个月后，巴黎世家的艺术总监 Demna（全名 Demna Gvasalia）在周五接受《Vogue》采访时表示，他再次对这些图片表示抱歉。
"I want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids and I take my responsibility," he told Vogue, echoing a previous statement he posted to social media in December.	他告诉《Vogue》，“我想亲自为孩子们礼物活动的错误艺术选择概念道歉，我为此承担责任，”这一点呼应了他去年 12 月在社交媒体上发布的声明。
In November, the brand shared photos for its "The Gift" collection, which featured child models posing with teddy bears that were dressed in bondage attire.	11 月，该品牌分享了其“礼物”系列的照片，其中包括穿着束缚服装的儿童模特与泰迪熊合影。
Shortly after, Balenciaga dropped photos for its spring 2023 campaign that featured a page from a 2008 Supreme Court case involving "virtual child pornography" in the background.	不久之后，巴黎世家放弃了其 2023 年春季活动的照片，这些照片以 2008 年最高法院涉及“虚拟儿童色情”的案件为背景。
Parents, including reality TV star and longtime Balenciaga fan - and brand partner - Kim Kardashian, spoke out against the brand and its "disturbing images" on social media.	所有父母，包括真人秀明星和巴黎世家的长期粉丝兼品牌合作伙伴 Kim Kardashian，在社交媒体上公开反对该品牌及其“令人不安的图像”。
Days later, Balenciaga released a statement apologizing for the photos and outlining the changes it would implement to avoid similar "mistakes" in the future.	几天后，巴黎世家发布了一份声明，为这些照片道歉，并表示将进行整改，以避免未来出现类似“错误”。
"This experience has forced me to reevaluate a lot of things in the way I, we, work, in the way we create and communicate images, the way we interact with our audiences, and the way we learn from our mistakes and move forward," Demna told Vogue.	德姆纳告诉《Vogue》：“这次经历迫使我重新评估我的工作方式，我们创造和交流图像的方式，我们与观众互动的方式，以及我们从错误中吸取教训并前进的方式。”
He detailed the postbacklash changes at Balenciaga: "restructuring the image department," conducting more internal and external checks for campaign imagery, and partnering with the National Children's Alliance to help "thousands of kids in the process of overcoming trauma and dealing with their mental health."	他详细介绍了巴黎世家遭到强烈抵制后的整改：“重组形象部”，对竞选形象进行更多的内部和外部检查，并与全国儿童联盟合作，帮助“成千上万的孩子克服创伤，对其心理健康问题进行处理。”
"It's the one thing that makes me happy about this whole horrible situation: to do something good out of it," he said of that partnership, which was announced Wednesday.	他谈到周三宣布的合作关系时说：“这是让我对整个糟糕的情况感到高兴的一件事：从中做点好事。”
Also teaming up with the NCA is Balenciaga's parent company, Kering, which oversees other luxury brands including Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.	与 NCA 合作的还有巴黎世家的母公司开云集团，该集团负责监管包括 Saint Laurent 和 Bottega Veneta 在内的其他奢侈品牌。
Under the Kering umbrella is Gucci, which faced backlash in December for a campaign featuring Harry Styles that some social media critics alleged also sexualized children.	在开云旗下的是古驰，它在 12 月份因一项以 Harry Styles 为主角的活动而面临强烈抵制，一些社交媒体批评者声称该活动也将儿童性别化。
In the interview, Denma said he plans to move away from the brand's "provocative" ways.	在采访中，Denma 表示，他计划远离该品牌的“挑衅”方式。
"This is part of my learning: I will have a more mature and serious approach to everything I release as an idea or an image," he said.	他表示，“这是我学习的一部分：我会以一种更成熟、更严肃的态度对待我发布的任何想法或图片。”
"I have decided to go back to my roots in fashion as well as to the roots of Balenciaga, which is making quality clothes - not making image or buzz."	“我已经决定回到我的时尚根源，以及巴黎世家的根源，这是制作高品质的衣服，而不是制作图像或噪音。”
Speaking of the brand's origins, elsewhere in the interview Demna said one of the most "painful" parts of the backlash was tarnishing "the name of Balenciaga and the legacy of Cristóbal Balenciaga."	在谈到品牌的起源时，Demna 在采访的其他地方表示，抵制中最“痛苦”的一部分是玷污“巴黎世家的名字和 Cristóbal Balenciaga 的遗产”
"Balenciaga is a house that is over one century old and is based on strong and beautiful creative values, and I have been busy doing all in my creative power to bring it to its modern relevance, and suddenly we were under attack and labeled as something we're not at all," Demna said.	Demna 表示，“巴黎世家是一个超过一个世纪历史的房子，它以重大创意价值和美好创意理念为根基，我一直在努力竭尽我的创造力使它与现代接轨，突然我们面临强烈抵制，被贴上了我们根本不存在的标签。”
"We certainly made a huge and stupid mistake with the gifting campaign, and we certainly have learned from it."	“我们肯定在送礼活动中犯了一个巨大而愚蠢的错误，我们确实已经从中吸取了教训。”
It's Fake News, CBN Debunks Claim It Lacks Capacity To Print More New Naira Notes	这是假新闻，CBN 驳斥称其没有能力印刷更多新的奈拉纸币
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has described as misleading, the report that claimed to be quoting CBN govemor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, as attributing the current challenge in the distribution of the newly redesigned Naira banknotes to a shortage of printing materials at the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Plc.	该报道声称引用尼日利亚中央银行行长 Godwin Emefiele 先生的话，将目前分发新设计的奈拉纸币的困难归咎于尼日利亚安全印刷和造币公司印刷材料短缺，尼日利亚中央银行称该报道具有误导性。
In a statement issued on Saturday, CBN spokesman, Osita Nwasinobi, said at no time did the CBN governor made such statement during his presentation to the National Council of State at its meeting on Friday, February 10, 2023.	在周六发表的一份声明中，CBN 发言人 Osita Nwasinobi 表示，CBN 州长在 2023 年 2 月 10 日星期五向国家国务委员会提交报告时从未发表过此类声明。
Mr Nwasinobi said Emefiele only told the meeting that the NSPMC was working on printing all denominations of the Naira to meet the transaction needs of Nigerians.	Nwasinobi 先生说，Emefiele 只是告诉会议说，尼日利亚国家货币发行委员会正在印刷所有面值的奈拉，以满足尼日利亚人的交易需求。
He said while the CBN appreciates the concerns shown by all stakeholders about the distribution of the new Naira notes, "we are alarmed at the extent to which vested interests are attempting to manipulate facts and pitch the public against the Bank."	他说，虽然中央银行理解所有利益相关者对新奈拉纸币发行的担忧，但“我们对既得利益者试图操纵事实和让公众反对银行的程度感到震惊。”
Nwasinobi said the CBN remains committed to performing its monetary policy functions, as stipulated in the CBN Act, 2007 (as amended).	Nwasinobi 表示，CBN 仍然致力于履行其货币政策职能，正如 2007 年 CBN 法案（经修订）所规定的那样。
"We also wish to restate that the NSPMC has the capacity and enough materials to produce the required indent of the Naira.	“我们还希望重申，NSPMC 有能力和足够的材料来生产奈拉所需的订单。
"The bank, therefore, wishes to appeal to the public to disregard the said report and exercise more restraint, even as we work assiduously to increase the circulation of the new notes in the country," he added.	他补充道，“因此，银行希望呼吁公众不要理会上述报告，即使我们正在努力在该国的流通中增加新钞票，更应该保持克制。”
On a particular voice note trending on the social media alleging that the CBN planned to shut down some banks, particularly in a particular geopolitical region of the country, the CBN said there was no such plan and that the claims were illogical and do not comply with the workings of the Nigerian banking system.	在社交媒体上流行的一条特定语音消息称，尼日利亚中央银行计划关闭一些银行，特别是在该国的一个特定地缘政治地区，该银行表示，没有这样的计划，这些说法是不合逻辑的，不符合尼日利亚银行系统的运作。
"The public is therefore advised to ignore such recordings as they do not represent the policy thrust of the CBN and are only the desperate attempts of persons bent on inciting the public against the Bank," he stated.	他表示，“因此，建议公众忽略这些录音，因为它们并不代表中央银行的政策主旨，只是那些一心煽动公众反对中央银行的人的绝望企图。”
Tim Sherwood tears into £44m signing Pedro Porro after dismal Tottenham debut	托特纳姆首秀惨淡后，蒂姆·舍伍德以 4400 万英镑签下佩德罗·波罗
Porro had an afternoon to forget against Leicester (Picture: Getty)	波罗度过了一个难忘的下午，对阵莱切斯特城（图片：Getty）
Tim Sherwood tore into Pedro Porro's "absolutely disgusting" defending during Tottenham's 4-1 defeat to Leicester City.	在热刺 1-4 输给莱切斯特城的比赛中，蒂姆·舍伍德抨击了佩德罗·波罗“绝对恶心”的防守。
Spurs signed the right-back from Sporting CP on transfer deadline day on an initial loan deal for £5million with the obligation to buy this summer for £39million.	热刺在转会截止日以 500 万英镑的初始租借合同从 Sporting CP 签下了这名右后卫，并有义务在今年夏天以 3900 万英镑的价格购买。
The 23-year-old was handed his debut by Antonio Conte on Saturday at the King Power Stadium with his side taking the lead after 14 minutes through Rodrigo Bentancur.	这位 23 岁的球员在周六的国王电力球场首次亮相，他的球队在第 14 分钟由罗德里戈·本坦库尔取得领先。
But it turned into an miserable afternoon with Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison and Kelechi Iheanacho all scoring to give Leicester a 3-1 at half-time with Porro enduring a torrid first-half in the Premier League.	但这变成了一个悲惨的下午，纳姆帕利斯·门迪，詹姆斯·马迪森和克莱奇·伊希纳乔都进球了，让莱切斯特在半场时以 3-1 领先，而波罗在英超联赛中忍受了炎热的上半场。
The Spaniard was at fault again as Leicester thought they had added a fourth through Barnes and while the goal was ruled out for offside, former Spurs manager Sherwood was left shocked by the full-back's defensive efforts.	西班牙人再次犯错，莱斯特认为他们通过巴恩斯增加了第四个进球，虽然这个进球被判越位，但前马刺队主教练舍伍德对这位后卫的防守努力感到震惊。
"I don't want to keep picking on the kid but he needs to be relieved of his duties," Sherwood told Soccer Saturday.	舍伍德在接受《Soccer Saturday》采访时表示：“我不想一直责备这孩子，应该解除他的职务。”
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because it is his debut but Pedro Porro is no bad it is unbelievable.	我认为，这是他的处子秀，Pedro Porro 表现并不差，才惊四座。
His positioning is absolutely disgusting, Barnes and Maddison are destroying him down the left hand side.	他的定位真令人反感，Barnes 和 Maddison 从左手边赶超了他。
Daniel Levy was saying this week, they have spent a lot of money, yes they have, but their recruitment has been very poor and this is the latest addition.	丹尼尔·利维本周表示，他们已经花了很多钱，的确如此，他们已经花了很多钱，但是他们的招募工作非常糟糕，这是对最近情况的补充。
Let's not make any conclusions at the moment but what I am looking at is a player who does not want to defend.	我们现在不要妄下断语，而我看他是一个不想防守的球员。
More: Premier League	更多：英超联赛
"Antonio Conte has complained about the defending and this player, at the moment is struggling to defend. He is up against very good players in Barnes and Maddison but it is very disappointing."	“安东尼奥·孔蒂对防守颇有微词，这名球员现在正在努力防守。他面对的是 Barnes 和 Maddison 的优秀球员，但这令人非常失望。”
While the goal was ruled out, Leicester restored their 4-1 lead with Barnes on target nine minutes from full-time.	虽然进球被判罚无效，但莱斯特在离全场结束还有 9 分钟时，由 Barnes 瞄准目标，恢复了他们 4-1 的领先优势。
Despite beating Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move ahead of Newcastle into third place.	尽管上周击败了曼城，但热刺错过了超越纽卡斯尔进入第三名的机会。

Jack Smith should win any privilege fight over Mike Pence subpoena	杰克·史密斯应该赢得任何关于迈克·彭斯传票的特权斗争
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to muck up this latest development in the Justice Department's probe?	特别顾问杰克·史密斯传唤迈克·彭斯的消息引发了一个问题：特朗普团队将如何利用法院来搞乱司法部调查的最新进展？
The short answer is that any attempt to scuttle the Pence subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail.	简单而言，任何以行政特权为由阻挠彭斯传票的企图都应该失败。
First off, there's a threshold question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege.	首先，有一个门槛问题，前总统是否可以要求这种特权。
Recall that Trump tried and failed to block the House Jan. 6 committee from getting White House records.	回想一下，特朗普试图阻止众议院 1 月 6 日委员会获得白宫记录，但失败了。
The Supreme Court declined to take up Trump's appeal last year, with only Justice Clarence Thomas (husband of 2020 election denier Ginni Thomas) dissenting.	最高法院去年拒绝受理特朗普的上诉，只有大法官克拉伦斯·托马斯（2020 年选举否认者吉尼·托马斯的丈夫）持异议。
But the court left open the question of whether an ex-president can claim privilege, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting he'd support such a claim.	但法院对前总统是否可以主张特权的问题没有做出决定，大法官布雷特·卡瓦诺表示他会支持这样的主张。
So it's at least unclear whether a former president can claim the privilege, saying nothing of whether the claim would succeed.	因此，至少不清楚一位前总统是否可以要求这种特权，更不用说这种要求是否会成功。
Plus, the Supreme Court appeal over then-President Richard Nixon's attempt to avoid subpoena compliance shows that a vague privilege assertion won't do, and can be overcome by a specific need for evidence.	此外，最高法院对时任总统理查德·尼克松试图避免遵守传票的上诉表明，模糊的特权主张是不行的，可以通过具体的证据需求来克服。
The court observed in 1974"s United States v. Nixon:	法院在 1974 年的美国诉尼克松案中指出：
... when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.	...当主张在刑事审判中使用传讯材料的特权的理由仅仅是基于保密的普遍利益时，它不能凌驾于公平刑事司法中正当法律程序的基本要求之上。
The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.	在未决的刑事审判中，对特权的广义断言必须服从于对证据的明确、具体的需要。
Therefore, precedent is on the government's side.	因此，先例是站在政府一边的。
Of course, however, delays from litigating even a losing issue can be a victory of sorts for Trump.	然而，当然，对特朗普来说，拖延诉讼甚至是一个失败的问题也可能是一种胜利。
But further dampening the odds of a successful privilege claim is the previous rejection of Trump's attempt to block Jan. 6 grand jury testimony.	但进一步降低特权主张成功几率的是，特朗普此前拒绝阻止 1 月 6 日大陪审团作证的企图。
As The Washington Post reported in October, that rejection noted that former Pence aide Marc Short, for example, "probably possessed information important to the Justice Department's criminal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol that was not available from other sources."	正如《华盛顿邮报》10 月份报道的那样，该拒绝指出，前彭斯助手 Marc Short“可能拥有对司法部 2021 年 1 月 6 日袭击国会大厦的刑事调查至关重要的信息，这些信息无法从其他来源获得。”
That Pence, too, likely has unique information would help the DOJ in any subpoena fight.	彭斯也可能拥有独特的信息，这将有助于司法部在任何传票斗争中发挥作用。
And the reason we think Pence has such information is yet another reason that a privilege claim should fail.	而我们认为彭斯掌握这种信息的原因是特权要求应该失败的另一个原因。
That's because Pence has chosen to write publicly about at least some of his supposed conversations with Trump in connection with Jan. 6.	这是因为彭斯选择公开写下至少一些他与特朗普在 1 月 6 日的对话。
It's hard to say communications are privileged when you've previously deemed them fit to publicize.	当你以前认为通信适合公开时，很难说它们是特权。
So while the subpoena might present varying political and personal calculations for Pence - who may vie for the 2024 Republican nomination against Trump, someone who effectively condoned calls for Pence's extrajudicial execution on Jan. 6 - the courts should have an easy time siding with DOJ on privilege.	因此，尽管传票可能会对彭斯提出不同的政治和个人考量 - 彭斯可能会在 2024 年与特朗普争夺共和党提名，特朗普在 1 月 6 日实际上纵容了对彭斯进行法外处决的呼吁 - 但法院应该很容易在特权问题上站在司法部一边。
The Case Against a Biden Run Is Obvious - and Weak	反对拜登竞选的理由是显而易见的，也是站不住脚的
Why is this important?	为什么这很重要？
While Biden and his fellow Democrats can't do much in the way of passing laws with the GOP in control of the House, they can still spend the next two years setting an example.	虽然拜登和他的民主党同僚在共和党控制众议院的情况下无法在通过法律方面有所作为，但他们仍然可以在未来两年内树立榜样。
Collectively, everyone on the team should be seeking out opportunities to play Gallant to the Republicans" weird Goofus impulses.	总的来说，团队中的每个人都应该寻找机会向共和党人怪异的愚蠢冲动献殷勤。
But it's also important for Biden to burnish his credibility with the American people - and maybe be a direly needed change agent in our all-too-tatty political culture.	但对拜登来说，提高他在美国人民中的可信度也很重要，也许他是我们过于保守的政治文化中急需的变革推动者。
Washington, a notoriously cynical place, is famous for its common sense-crippling ideas about leadership.	华盛顿是一个出了名的愤世嫉俗的地方，以其关于领导力的常识性思维而闻名。
Perhaps one of the most notorious is the odd standard that holds that publicly admitting errors is a sign of weakness and that politicians should go to comical lengths to avoid doing so.	也许最臭名昭著的是一个奇怪的标准，认为公开承认错误是软弱的表现，政治家应该尽可能避免这样做。
There's another way: In Bailout, Neil Barofsky's memoir of his time in Washington serving as the special inspector general overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, he described the advice he received from Kristine Belisle, the woman he smartly hired to be his communications director.	还有另一种方法：在 Neil Barofsky 的回忆录《紧急财政援助》（Bailout）中，他描述了自己在华盛顿担任监督问题资产救助计划（TARP）的特别监察长期间，从 Kristine Belisle 那里得到的建议，他聘请了这位女士担任他的联络主任，此乃明智之举。
It was about as anti-Washington as it can get: "We'll admit and even highlight our mistakes."	这是反华盛顿程度最高的了：“我们会承认甚至强调我们的错误。”
As she went on to explain, there's method in a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would deem madness:	正如她继续解释的那样，环城高速公路内的大多数人会认为这种策略是疯狂的：
This is the best way to earn the press's trust.	这是赢得媒体信任的最好方法。
They'll know we're not spinning like everyone else.	他们会明白我们不像其他人一样迅速变卦。
SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source for information in Washington about TARP.	SIGTARP 将很快成为美国政府关于 TARP 的唯一可靠消息来源。
We might be embarrassed at times and disclose things that we could - and others would - easily hide, but we'll shock the press with our honesty.	我们有时可能会感到尴尬，并透露一些我们可以 - 以及其他人会 - 轻易隐瞒的事情，但我们会用我们的真诚打动媒体。
No one else does this, and before long, we'll have a built in defense when we're attacked.	其他人不会这样做，不久，当我们受到攻击时，我们将有一个内部防御策略。
No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us, because we'll prove to them that we tell the truth.	不管他们听到什么，媒体会先来找我们并相信我们，因为我们会向他们证明我们说的是实话。
This is perhaps the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of radical responsibility-taking: Moments inevitably arise in any presidency when having the trust of the public and the institutions that safeguard the civic interest is critical.	这也许是拜登追求激进责任路线的最大原因：任何一位总统都不可避免地会遇到这样的时刻：公众和捍卫公民利益的机构的信任至关重要。
Moreover, there is vital capital to be earned by owning our mistakes, and there's an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents.	此外，承认我们的错误可以获得至关重要的资本，拜登可以与他的政治对手划清界限。
The president would do well to follow the old adage: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.	总统最好遵循这句古老的格言：说出真相 - 让魔鬼羞愧。

Biden DOJ 'Doesn't Want an Armed Citizenry'	拜登政府司法部“不希望有武装的公民”
Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) sat down with Breitbart News on Thursday and discussed his plans to block the ATF pistol brace rule and his conviction that the Biden Department of Justice "doesn't want an armed citizenry" in the first place.	代表安德鲁·克莱德（共和党）周四接受了 Breitbart News 的采访，讨论了他阻止 ATF 手枪支架规则的计划，以及他对拜登司法部首先“不希望有武装的公民”的信念。
Clyde made clear his opposition to the pistol brace rule.	克莱德明确表示他反对手枪支架规则。
His reasons for that opposition include both general objections and more specific ones.	他反对的理由包括一般反对意见和更具体的反对意见。
Generally, he expressed his conviction that our Founding Fathers did not set forth a plan of governance that included federal agencies making laws in place of the legislature.	总的来说，他表达了他的信念，我们的开国元勋们没有制定一个包括联邦机构代替立法机构制定法律的治理计划。
He said, "The Justice Department is there to enforce the law, not to make the law. When you have the executive branch making the law and enforcing the law, then you have have a king, and a kingdom. Our Founders did not call for a king and they did not lay out a kingdom in the Constitution of the United States."	他说，“司法部是来执法的，不是来制定法律的。当行政部门制定法律并执行法律时，就是王国专政的时代了。我们的建国者没有要求实现王国专政，他们也没有在美国宪法中规划一个王国制度。”
Clyde then moved to specifics regarding the pistol brace rule and expressed his concern that the rule is part of a greater ATF push to acquire broader registration of firearms.	克莱德接着谈到了有关手枪支架规则的细节，并表达了他对该规则的关注，该规则是 ATF 为获得更广泛的枪支注册所做的更大努力的一部分。
He noted, "What the ATF wants is they want to increase the registration database for the National Firearms Act. They want to register people across the country because, as we know, what comes before confiscation is registration. And confiscation, in my opinion, is the ultimate goal, because this Justice Department doesn't want an armed citizenry."	他指出，“烟酒枪支管理局想要的是增加国家枪支法案的注册数据库。他们想在全国范围内对人们进行登记，因为正如我们所知，在没收之前首先要进行登记。在我看来，没收是最终目标，因为司法部不希望有武装的公民。”
He added, "But this Justice Department wants a registered citizenry, so they know who's got what, so they can come after us."	他补充道，“而司法部想要一个注册的公民，所以他们想要知道谁有什么，他们会跟踪我们。”
Clyde's contention is that the ATF pistol brace rule was born in this environment of hostility toward the Second Amendment and toward private gun ownership, and he plans to fight it tooth and nail.	克莱德的论点是，ATF 手枪支架规则是在这种敌视第二修正案和私人拥有枪支的环境中诞生的，他计划竭尽全力与之斗争。
He said he has "three tools" with which to fight the rule.	他说他有“三个工具”来对抗规则。
The first of those tools is the SHORT Act and the second is the Congressional Review Act.	第一个工具是《SHORT 法案》，第二个是《国会审查法案》。
On January 30 Breitbart News quoted Clyde outlining his plan to "reintroduce the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act, or the SHORT Act, to repeal elements of the National Firearms Act, thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and banning pistols with stabilizing braces."	1 月 30 日，Breitbart News 援引 Clyde 概述了他的计划，即“重新引入《今日停止骚扰步枪拥有者法案》，或 SHORT 法案，以废除《国家火器法案》的内容，从而禁止 ATF 注册和禁止带有稳定支架的手枪。”
He also noted that he would "introduce a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, to override the Biden administration's unlawful overreach."	他还指出，他将“根据国会审查法案提出一项不赞成的决议，以推翻拜登政府的非法越权行为。”
Both acts, the SHORT Act and the Congressional Review Act, have the possibility of blocking the ATF pistol brace rule.	这两项法案，即《SHORT 法案》和《国会审查法案》，都有可能阻止 ATF 手枪支架规则。
But as Clyde told Breitbart News Thursday, the great challenge is that both of those routes will ultimately require President Biden's signature, either to enact the SHORT Act legislation or to finalize a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act.	但是，正如克莱德周四告诉 Breitbart News 的那样，最大的挑战是，这两条路线最终都需要拜登总统的签署，要么颁布短法案立法，要么根据国会审查法案最终确定不批准的决议。
He made clear that getting Biden's signature is not an impossibility, as there are ways; for instance, the SHORT Act legislation could be added to other, larger bills that Democrats are very anxious to pass.	他明确表示，得到拜登的签名不是不可能的，因为有办法；例如，短法案立法可以加入民主党人非常渴望通过的其他更大的法案中。
However, Clyde indicated there is also a third way to block the ATF pistol brace rule.	然而，克莱德指出，还有第三种方式来阻止 ATF 手枪支架规则。
He said: "I'm on the Appropriations Committee and we can defund this pistol brace rule, through what is called a limitation amendment. We can literally defund this rule and basically say, "No money may be spent executing or enforcing this particular pistol brace rule."	他表示：“我是拨款委员会的成员，我们可以通过所谓的限制修正案来废除这项手枪支架规则。我们可以从字面上解除这一规则，基本上可以说，“没有钱可以用来执行或实施这一特殊的手枪支架规则。”
And we can also do the very same thing with the ATF receiver/frame rule, from last August.	从去年八月开始，我们也可以用 ATF 接收器/框架规则做同样的事情。
I think both of them need to be defunded and I look forward to working with our appropriators to do it.	我认为这两者都需要被解除资助，我期待着与我们的拨款人一起工作。

'We Hope' Biden Has a Plan for Handling Title 42 Ending, 'If They Do, They Haven't Shared It Fully'	我们希望拜登有一个处理第 42 条结尾的计划，如果他们有，他们还没有完全将其共享出来
On Friday's edition of NBC's "MTP Now," Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said that he has "a lot of concern" over what will happen when Title 42 ends in May, he hopes the Biden administration has a plan for when the policy ends, and that "If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet."	在美国全国广播公司周五的“MTP 时事”节目中，科罗拉多州州长 Jared Polis （D）表示，他“非常担心”第 42 条在 5 月结束时会发生什么，他希望拜登政府对该政策何时结束有一个计划，“如果他们有，他们还没有完全将其共享出来。”
And said that "we've said, you need a plan. We want them to vet it with us."	并说“我们已经说过，你需要一个计划。我们想让他们和我们一起检查。”
Polis stated that he wishes that more time was spent on the issue of immigration during the meeting of governors at the White House, but the issue "came up."	波利斯表示，他希望在白宫举行的州长会议期间，在移民问题上花更多的时间，但这个问题“出现了”。
We did have Secretary Mayorkas there for part of it.	我们确实有马约卡斯部长在场。
And so, we brought up, again, there's a lot of concern I share about what will happen when Title 42 ends in May and so, making sure that the federal government has a plan.	所以，我们再次提出，当第 42 条在 5 月结束时，我有很多担心，所以，确保联邦政府有一个计划。
We hope they do.	我们希望如此。
If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet.	如果他们知道，他们也没有与我们完全将其共享出来。
But we've said, you need a plan.	但是我们说过，你需要一个计划。
We want them to vet it with us.	我们想让他们和我们一起检查。
We want to make sure it's not what we experienced in December times five or times three, that would be a disaster for the country and it would be terrible for the Biden administration.	我们希望确保这不是我们在 12 月经历的五次或三次，那将是国家的灾难，对拜登政府来说是可怕的。

McDonald's withdraws "tasteless" advert near crematorium - RT World News	麦当劳撤回火葬场附近的“无味”广告
McDonald's has apologized after an advertisement for the fast-food chain's "McCrispy" burger was placed close to a crematorium in the UK - although some locals did see the funny side.	在英国，麦当劳快餐连锁店的“麦可思比”汉堡的广告被放置在火葬场附近后，麦当劳已经道歉——尽管一些当地人确实看到了有趣的一面。
The restaurant chain has pledged to remove the offending advertising hoarding following complaints from residents of Truro in the UK county of Cornwall.	在接到英国康沃尔郡特鲁罗居民的投诉后，这家连锁餐厅承诺拆除违规的广告牌。
It had gained attention on social media on Friday for being placed on a busy road directly opposite an establishment which offers cremation services.	周五，它在社交媒体上引起了关注，因为它被放置在一条繁忙的道路上，正对着一家提供火葬服务的机构。
The brightly lit advert, which was placed directly behind a sign pointing to the crematorium, was branded as "tasteless" by some angry locals.	这个灯光明亮的广告直接放在一个指向火葬场的标志后面，被一些愤怒的当地人称为“无味”。
"Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless and I'm sure some grieving family members won't like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one," said a resident whose mother-in-law was cremated at the funeral home last year, as quoted by British media.	英国媒体援引一位居民的话说：“虽然我能看到有趣的一面，但它毫无品味，我敢肯定，一些悲伤的家庭成员不会喜欢在前往彭芒特参加亲人的葬礼和火葬时看到它，”他的岳母去年在殡仪馆火化。
However, not everyone was quite so offended by the unfortunate placement of the advertisement, with one noting that a person's reaction to it would likely be influenced by "how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie."	然而，并不是每个人都因为广告的不当位置而受到冒犯，其中一个人指出，一个人对它的反应可能会受到“你多久前戴着黑色领带跟随火葬场标志”的影响。
One person said they "fell off the chair laughing" when they spotted the advert online, while it was also noted by another local that it was "no worse" than the council's decision to entertain the idea of allowing a crematorium to be built "next door to a retirement village."	一个人说，当他们在网上看到这个广告时，他们“笑得从椅子上掉了下来”，而另一个当地人也指出，这个广告“不比市政会考虑允许火葬场建在“退休村隔壁”的想法更糟”。
A statement issued by McDonald's was published by local media on Friday soon after an image of the advertisement went viral online, in which the restaurant chain said it would remove the advert as soon as possible.	周五，在该广告的图片在网上疯传后不久，当地媒体发表了麦当劳的一份声明，这家连锁餐厅表示将尽快删除该广告。
"We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop. However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed," the fast-food brand said.	这家快餐品牌表示：“我们没有注意到这个公共汽车站附近的路标。然而，鉴于 CornwallLive 提出的担忧，我们已经要求撤掉我们的广告。”
Cornwall Council, which operates both the crematorium and the bus shelter which displays the advert, declined the comment on the furor when contacted by local media.	当地媒体联系康沃尔郡议会时，该委员会拒绝就这一狂热发表评论。康沃尔郡议会同时运营着火葬场和展示广告的公交车站。
'Gut instinct' missing woman is not in river	直觉告诉他该女性不在河里
Searches for missing English woman Nicola Bulley have entered a 16th day after her partner said his "gut instinct" is that she is not in the river.	对失踪的英国女子尼古拉·布利的搜寻已经进入第 16 天，她的搭档说他的“直觉”是她不在河里。
Lancashire Police said officers are keeping an "open mind" while continuing to appeal for information about Ms Bulley, who disappeared on 27 January while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre.	兰开夏郡警方表示，警方在继续呼吁提供关于布莉女士的信息时保持“开放的心态”，布莉女士于 1 月 27 日在怀尔的圣迈克尔遛狗时失踪。
The force is continuing to search the River Wyre towards the sea at Morecambe Bay, working on one hypothesis that the 45-year-old, from Inskip, could have fallen in.	警方仍在继续搜索怀尔河流向莫肯贝湾的海域，根据一个假设，这名来自因斯基普的 45 岁男子可能是掉进河里的。
Their search has been aided by specialists and divers from HM Coastguard, mountain rescue, and Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, with sniffer dogs, drones, and police helicopters deployed.	他们的搜索得到了英国皇家海岸警卫队、山地救援队和兰开夏郡消防救援队的专家和潜水员的帮助，并部署了嗅探犬、无人机和警用直升机。
Ms Bulley vanished while walking her springer spaniel Willow near the river, shortly after dropping her daughters, aged six and nine, at school.	布莉女士在把她六岁和九岁的女儿送到学校后不久，在河边遛她的斯宾格猎犬柳树时失踪了。
The mortgage adviser's phone was found on a bench overlooking the river, still connected to a work call.	这位抵押贷款顾问的手机被发现放在一张俯瞰河流的长椅上，仍然连接着一个工作电话。
Her partner, Paul Ansell said he wants to keep "all options open" about her disappearance, but his "gut instinct" tells him she is not in the river.	她的伴侣保罗·安塞尔说，他希望对她的失踪保持“所有选项开放”，但他的“直觉”告诉他，她不在河里。
He described Ms Bulley as "fun," "loving," "the most loyal friend you could ever have" and an "exceptional mum" who "absolutely adores our girls."	他将布莉女士描述为“有趣”、“可爱”、“你能拥有的最忠诚的朋友”以及“非常爱我们的女儿”的“杰出的妈妈”。
"She's just a pillar of strength to our family and without her, the hole is bigger than you can possibly imagine," he told 5 News.	他告诉 5 News：“她是我们家的支柱，没有她，这个深渊比你想象的还要大。”
Mr Ansell said that although the family is going through "unprecedented hell," hope that his partner will be found is "stronger than ever."	安塞尔先生说，虽然这个家庭正在经历“前所未有的地狱”，但找到他的伴侣的希望“比以往任何时候都强烈”。
Police have discounted foul play and are treating the incident as a missing person inquiry.	警方不认为这是谋杀，并将此事件视为失踪人口调查。
On Thursday, the focus of their search switched from St Michael's to around 10 miles downstream where the river empties into the sea at Morecambe Bay, with patrol and rescue boats spotted in the area.	周四，他们的搜索重点从圣迈克尔转移到下游约 10 英里处，那里是河流在莫克姆湾入海的地方，巡逻队和救援船在该地区开展工作。
East Germany's last communist leader dies at 95	东德最后一位共产党领导人去世，享年 95 岁
BERLIN (AP) - Hans Modrow, who served as East Germany's last communist leader during a turbulent tenure that ended in the country's first and only free election, has died.	柏林（美联社）-汉斯·莫德罗，东德最后一位共产党领导人，在混乱的任期内，结束了该国第一次也是唯一一次自由选举，与世长辞。
He was 95.	享年 95 岁。
Modrow died early Saturday, the Left party parliamentary group tweeted.	左翼党议会小组在推特上写道，莫德罗于周六早些时候去世。
Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification.	莫德罗，一个具有改革思想的共产主义者，在柏林墙倒塌后不久接管了东德，后来邀请反对派力量加入政府，但无法减缓德国统一的势头。
"The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his," the Left wrote on Twitter."That will remain his political legacy."	左派人士在 Twitter 上写道：“建立德国统一的整个和平进程正是他的一项特殊成就，”“这将成为他的政治遗产。”
During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure.	从 1973 年开始，在担任德累斯顿共产党总书记的 16 年间，莫德罗建立了反体制人物的名声。
He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.	他拒绝派对津贴，坚持住在普通公寓里。
A post in East Germany's top leadership eluded him until he was made prime minister, a position that previously carried little clout, in November 1989 - days after the fall of the Berlin Wall.	直到 1989 年 11 月，柏林墙倒塌后几天，他被任命为总理，这是一个以前没有什么影响力的职位。
When hard-line leader Egon Krenz and his ruling Politburo resigned in early December, Modrow emerged as East Germany's top political figure.	当强硬派领导人埃贡·克伦茨和他的政治局在 12 月初辞职时，莫德罗成为东德的最高政治人物。
But the communists could no longer call the shots on their own.	但是共产主义者再也不能独自发号施令了。
The following month, he agreed to share power with the increasingly vocal opposition and moved up East Germany's landmark first free election to March 1990, amid growing unrest.	接下来的一个月，他同意与呼声渐高的反对派共享权力，并将东德具有里程碑意义的第一次自由选举提前到 1990 年 3 月，当时动荡日益加剧。
Even as pro-democracy rallies rapidly took on a pro-unification flavor, the communists initially had opposed talk of reunification.	支持民主的集会迅速发展，带有支持统一的色彩，而共产党最初反对统一的说法。
In February 1990, however, Modrow urged talks with West Germany toward an eventual "united fatherland" that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint parliament in Berlin.	然而，1990 年 2 月，莫德罗敦促与西德进行谈判，以最终建立一个独立于军事集团、由柏林联合议会管理的“统一的祖国”。
Modrow headed the election campaign of the restyled communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, but his personal popularity was not enough to prevent them finishing as only the third-strongest party, with 16 percent support.	莫德罗领导了重建后的共产主义者民主社会主义党的竞选活动，但他的个人声望不足以阻止他们仅以 16% 的支持率成为第三大党。
The winner was an alliance of conservative parties that favored quick reunification and was backed by the government of West German leader Helmut Kohl.	获胜者是主张快速统一的保守派政党联盟，并得到西德领导人赫尔穆特·科尔政府的支持。
Germany reunited under Kohl's leadership and as a NATO member on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall.	1990 年 10 月 3 日，在柏林墙倒塌不到一年后，德国在美国柯尔百货公司的领导下重新统一，并成为北约成员国。
Modrow became a member of the united parliament, where he sat until 1994, and honorary chairman of the post-communist PDS - the predecessor of today's opposition Left party. From 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament.	莫德罗成为了联合议会的成员，直到 1994 年，他还是后共产主义社会民主党的名誉主席，该党是今天的反对党左翼党的前身。从 1999 年到 2004 年，他是欧洲议会的成员。
Modrow's past under hard-line communist rule landed him in court several years after reunification.	莫德罗过去在共产党的强硬统治下，在两德统一几年后被送上法庭。
In 1995, a court convicted him of inciting the falsification of results in May 1989 local elections in Dresden.	1995 年，法院判定他在 1989 年 5 月德累斯顿地方选举中煽动伪造结果。
It handed him a nine-month suspended sentence and a fine.	法院判处他 9 个月缓刑和罚款。
Modrow claimed that the trial was politically motivated and asserted that its outcome would aggravate divisions between east and west Germans.	莫德罗声称审判是出于政治动机，并断言其结果将加剧东德和西德之间的分歧。
His attorney argued that he had made amends for previous injustices by overseeing free elections as prime minister.	他的律师辩称，他作为总理监督了自由选举，从而弥补了之前的不公。
Later in life, Modrow served on the council of elders of the Left party.	晚年，莫德罗在左翼政党长老理事会任职。
"Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left party parliamentary group.	左翼党议会党团主席迪特马尔·巴奇在推特上表示：“汉斯是一个非常真诚和好斗的社会主义者。”
"Until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."	“直到晚年，他一直是我党的重要顾问，我们将怀念他的智慧。”
Indian govt withdraws appeal to hug cows on Valentine's Day after criticism	印度政府撤回在情人节拥抱奶牛的呼吁
Hugging a cow on Valentine's Day is no longer being encouraged by the Indian government - despite it previously asking people to do so to promote Hindu values.	印度政府不再鼓励在情人节拥抱一头奶牛，尽管此前政府曾要求人们这样做，以推广印度教价值观。
The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) retracted its "Cow Hug Day" appeal after it attracted criticism from political rivals and social media users.	印度（AWBI）动物福利委员会撤回了其“抱牛日”的呼吁，此前该呼吁招致了政治对手和社交媒体用户的批评。
The Indian government department had called on citizens to deviate from Western romantic gestures celebrated on Valentine's Day.	印度政府部门呼吁公民在情人节这天不要做出西方的浪漫举动。
Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the call to hug cows had been "absolutely crazy, defying logic."	政治分析家 Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay 表示，拥抱奶牛的呼吁“绝对疯狂，违背逻辑。”
He added that the decision to withdraw the appeal was more "to prevent the politics of Hindutva [Hindu nationalism] from being ridiculed in the face of severe criticism from all quarters."	他补充说，撤回上诉的决定更多的是为了“防止印度教民族主义（Hindutva）的政治在面临来自各方的严厉批评时受到嘲笑。”
The AWBI reneged on its appeal on Friday saying it "stands withdrawn."	AWBI 周五否认了其上诉，称其“撤回”
It was only on Wednesday when its statement read that "hugging cows [would] bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness."	直到周三，它的声明才写道“拥抱奶牛（将）带来丰富的情感，增加个人和集体福祉。”
More on India	更多关于印度的信息
It added that the cow is the "backbone of Indian culture and rural economy... because of its nourishing nature like [a] mother."	它补充说，奶牛是“印度文化和农村经济的支柱”...因为它像母亲一样有滋养的天性。”
There were mixed reactions to the initial announcement as some posted videos of cows rejecting being hugged and charging off.	人们对最初的声明反应不一，一些人上传了奶牛拒绝被拥抱并逃跑的视频。
Others wanted to clarify that the appeal was more for following one's own culture, as opposed to "blindly" following Western values.	其他人希望澄清，呼吁更多的是遵循自己的文化，而不是“盲目”遵循西方价值观。
Young Indians typically spend Valentine's Day crowding parks and restaurants, exchanging gifts and holding parties.	年轻的印度人通常在拥挤的公园和餐馆里度过情人节，交换礼物并举行聚会。
Cow cuddling is nothing new either - with it being considered therapeutic in parts of the world, and in The Netherlands where it is known as "koe knuffelen."	拥抱奶牛也不是什么新鲜事——在世界的一些地方，它被认为是一种治疗方法，在荷兰，它被称为“koe knuffelen”。
Devout Hindus worship the cow - known as gau mata, or "mother cow" - and most states in India have banned cow slaughter.	虔诚的印度教徒崇拜这种被称为 gau mata 或“母牛”的牛，印度大多数邦都禁止宰杀牛。
In recent years, certain Hindu hard-liners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day goes against traditional values and promotes promiscuity.	近年来，某些印度教强硬派袭击了出售情人节商品的商店，焚烧卡片和礼物，并将手拉手的情侣赶出餐馆和公园，坚称这一天违背传统价值观，助长滥交。
Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have said such raids help reassert a Hindu identity.	印度教民族主义团体，如 Shiv Sena 和 Bajrang Dal 说，这种袭击有助于重申印度教的身份。
Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda, seeking the religion's supremacy in a secular nation known for its diversity.	总理纳伦德拉·莫迪的批评者说，莫迪政府推动了一项印度教议程，在一个以多样性著称的世俗国家寻求宗教至高无上的地位。
While Hindus comprise almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the rest.	虽然印度教徒占近 14 亿人口的近 80%，但穆斯林、基督徒、锡克教徒、佛教徒和耆那教徒占其余的大部分。

I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash-cam footage which could assist our investigation to contact us.	我也呼吁在该地区开车的人和可能有 dash-cam 镜头的人与我们联系，这可能有助于我们的调查。
"Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."	“任何能提供帮助的人都被要求拨打苏格兰警察 101，引用 2023 年 2 月 10 日星期五的事件编号 1638。”
IN NUMBERS: The Oslo boroughs where the most foreigners live	在数字中：外国人最多的奥斯陆行政区
Roughly 177,000 of Oslo's 634,000's residents have immigrated to Norway from other countries.	奥斯陆 63.4 万居民中，大约有 17.7 万人从其他国家移民到挪威。
When you include those born in Oslo to foreign parents, the proportion of those who are immigrants or have an immigrant background rises to more than a third.	如果把出生在奥斯陆、父母是外国人的人计算在内，移民或有移民背景的人的比例将超过三分之一。
In Oslo, citizens from Asia, including Turkey, made up the largest immigrant group, with over 62,985 of these nationals living in the city, according to figures from the national data agency Statistics Norway (SSB).	根据国家数据机构挪威统计局（SSB）的数据，在奥斯陆，包括土耳其在内的亚洲公民构成了最大的移民群体，其中超过 62985 人生活在这座城市。

Zimbabwe to Start Operating New Coal Power Unit by March	津巴布韦将于三月开始运行新的煤电机组
By Florence Tan	记者：Florence Tan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will start operating a new unit at its only coal-fired power plant by March, says the country's deputy energy minister, providing relief to millions of citizens rocked by frequent power outages in recent months.	BENGALURU（路透社）- 津巴布韦能源部副部长称，该国唯一的燃煤电厂将于 3 月开始运行一个新机组，为近几个月频繁停电的数百万公民提供救济。
The new unit of the Hwange power plant will lift the African nation's installed capacity by more than 14% to 2400 megawatts.	万基电厂的新机组将把这个非洲国家的装机容量提高 14% 以上，达到 2400 兆瓦。
The next unit is expected to be commissioned soon after, Magna Mudyiwa said, without giving a timeline.	Magna Mudyiwa 说，下一个单元预计将很快投入使用，但没有给出时间表。
Less than half of Zimbabwe's 16 million citizens have access to electricity, and a global squeeze on funding new coal-fired capacity has limited the country's ability to plug chronic power cuts that have lasted as long as 18 hours in recent days.	津巴布韦 1600 万公民中只有不到一半的人用上了电，全球对新燃煤发电能力的资金短缺限制了该国解决长期停电问题的能力，最近几天，停电已经持续了 18 个小时。
"We have the capacity to generate up to 2100 megawatts (MW) from our power sources but at the moment we're generating far less than that..about 1000MW," Mudyiwa told Reuters.	Mudyiwa 告诉路透社：“我们的发电能力高达 2100 兆瓦，但目前我们的发电量远远低于这个数字..大约 1000 兆瓦。”
"But our demand for electricity is about 1700MW so we have a serious deficit," she said.	她表示：“但我们的电力需求约为 1700 兆瓦，因此我们有严重的缺口。”
Deficient rainfall has led to a decline in hydropower generation, while the efficiency of the sole, decades-old coal-fired utility has dipped sharply over time while power demand has surged in recent years due to higher mining and agricultural activity.	降雨量不足导致水力发电量下降，而随着时间的推移，这家拥有数十年历史的唯一燃煤电厂的效率大幅下降，而近年来，由于采矿和农业活动增加，电力需求激增。
The International Monetary Fund counts electricity shortages as one of the major factors weighing on Zimbabwe's growth prospects.	国际货币基金组织认为电力短缺是影响津巴布韦经济增长的主要因素之一。
Lack of funding for coal-fired power is driving the mining and agriculture-dependent economy to import costly power from regional neighbors including Zambia and Mozambique.	燃煤发电缺乏资金正推动依赖矿业和农业的经济从赞比亚和莫桑比克等地区邻国进口昂贵的电力。

And [PERSON11] now has the time.	[PERSON11] 现在有时间了。
There are other things where I was thinking of [PERSON11] and that would be training of, empty systems, so that they do the shortening.	我还想到了其他一些事情 [PERSON11]，那就是对空系统进行培训，以便它们能够缩短时间。
So, if you, [PERSON11], had the time.	因此，如果您 [PERSON11] 有时间。
Obviously, there is no way we could do it for next week.	很明显，我们不可能在下周做这件事。
But we should really have the system – ready for –	但是我们真的应该让这个系统 - 准备好 -
I looked at the tutorial from the NLP – was it?	我看了 NLP 的教程 - 是吗？
(PERSON6) For the upcoming sessions and I've asked about demand because I've seen the (meme) project demo.	[PERSON6] 对于即将到来的会议，我已经询问了需求，因为我已经看过了（meme）项目演示。
They do offline subtitling.	他们做离线字幕。
So, that's slightly easier than what we do.	所以，这比我们做的要简单一点。
They still have the same segmentation issues and so on.	他们仍然有相同的分割问题等等。
But their mission in translation is shortening simply because the data is shortening.	但是他们的翻译任务正在缩短，仅仅是因为数据在缩短。
And that's because their target size is the subtitles, which are created for the hearing-impaired.	这是因为他们的目标尺寸是为听力受损的人制作的字幕。
So, there is like a natural shortening in the data.	所以，数据中有一个自然的缩短。
It'd be great if we could also locate such a type of data where there is some natural shortening happening.	如果我们也能找到这样一种存在自然缩短的数据，那就太好了。
We would put it in the architecture.	我们会把它放在建筑里。
(PERSON8) That takes a bit of time, because I need to figure out which one is the one which is getting passes.	[PERSON8] 这需要一点时间，因为我需要弄清楚哪一个是获得通行证的人。
So, once I know that, I can keep a track of it, so, for the future –	所以，一旦我知道了，我就可以跟踪它，为了未来 -
Or actually, for future I would not need it, because once I have the web file, I probably won't need to do a convert.	或者实际上，将来我不需要它，因为一旦我有了网络文件，我可能就不需要转换了。
(PERSON6) Well, this, this should actually be –	[PERSON6] 嗯，这实际上应该是 -
Can you still hear me?	你还能听到我吗？
The sound quality is a little worse.	音质差一点。
So, this should really be done, all the time.	所以，这真的应该一直做下去。
So, every time we run this evaluation, it should be run from scratch.	所以，我们每次运行这个评估，都应该从头开始运行。
So, every time, there should be a fresh download of a fresh conversion and a fresh evaluation.	所以，每一次，都要有一个新鲜的下载一个新鲜的转化，一个新鲜的评价。
(PERSON8) But still, if I am keeping track of the files that need to be manually converted, so that I can write a script, and it could take care of the known ones at least, and of course, if we add some new files, I can see for that later.	[PERSON8] 但是，如果我跟踪需要手动转换的文件，以便我可以编写一个脚本，它至少可以处理已知的文件，当然，如果我们添加一些新文件，我可以在以后看到。
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have come across months ago.	[PERSON6] 因此，这是我们几个月前就应该了解的一件重要事情。
Remember, it is since August that I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set.	请记住，从八月份开始，我就一直在告诉你们，我们想要在以后的测试集上进行评估。
And every time, you all...	每次，你们都...
It is not just you personally, [PERSON8].	不仅仅是你个人，[PERSON8]。
There were other things, obviously.	很明显，还有其他事情。
But every time you thought about that, you thought "this will be easy, we will just run it".	但是每次你想到这一点，你都会想“这很容易，我们只要运行它就行了”。
And only when you actually do it, do you see all the problems.	只有当你真正去做的时候，你才会发现所有的问题。
So, this is known, common.	所以，这是众所周知的，很常见。
It is always like that.	总是这样。
So that's a message for everybody.	所以这是给每个人的信息。
Before you try, you never know what the problem will be.	在你尝试之前，你永远不知道问题会是什么。
So, for example, the call that I had, in which someone was interviewing me, so they wanted to record the video.	举个例子，我接到一个电话，有人在采访我，所以他们想录下这段视频。
Zoom never worked as badly for me as it did today for the recording.	Zoom 对我来说从来没有像今天的录音这样糟糕过。
So, before you do it, you cannot say whether it will work or not.	所以，在你做之前，你不能说它会不会起作用。
And here we are running into the problems of conversion of the file formats.	这里我们遇到了文件格式转换的问题。
So, hopefully, we will be able to quickly get the numbers.	所以，希望我们能很快得到这些数字。
So, do you have any word error rates so far?	那么，到目前为止你有单词错误率吗？
(PERSON8) No, I have not processed it.	[PERSON8] 不，我没有处理过。
So [PERSON1] said that, once, they get the transcript, we will do it together.	所以 [PERSON1] 说，一旦他们拿到成绩单，我们就一起做。
And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary.	然后，我同意这本字典里有很多杂音。
So, I asked that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times.	所以，我要求你们通过只取被观察到的单词，有不同版本的字典，五次。
And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that.	只有那些被观察了三次或更多次的发音，或者类似的。
So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM.	所以，这样的话，这些随机错误，比如这个例子用这四个 IBM 代替 IBM。
This will not be so frequent.	这不会那么频繁。
But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the "Z".	但是，你仍然会有发音上的变化，因为如果这个人说这个“alzo”，如果你记得，如果他在演讲中说这个带“Z”的“alzo”20 次，那么你会在数据中看到带“Z”的。
And if he sometimes manages to say also correctly, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data.	如果他有时也能说对，那么你会在数据中看到。
So, I would like, [PERSON4] to be in touch with [PERSON2].	因此，我希望 [PERSON4] 与 [PERSON2] 保持联系。
Maybe you continue on the call, right?	也许你会继续打电话，对吗？
I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids lunch and so on.	我现在不得不离开，因为我需要给孩子们吃午饭等等。
But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary.	但请不要挂断电话，共同想出如何使用那本字典。
So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system is accepting.	因此 [PERSON4]，请向 [PERSON2] 展示系统正在接受的词典。
Share your screen and show it.	共享并显示您的屏幕。
And [PERSON2], please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file.	[PERSON2]，请看一下，并帮助将您发出的字典转换为该文件。
One thing that will still be needed is the language model substitute.	仍然需要的一件事是语言模型替代品。
But all these words should be known words.	但这些字都应该是认识的字。
So [PERSON4], you need to figure out what words are in the language model.	因此 [PERSON4]，您需要弄清楚语言模型中有哪些单词。
And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied.	并且应该简单地复制语言模型中的单词。
So, the dictionary will have three col ns.	因此，字典将有三栏。
The grapheme, as it is output.	输出的字母。
One recognized.	一个可辨认的。
The phonemes, as [PERSON2] proposed.	音素，正如 [PERSON2] 所建议的。
And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations.	并且将会有具有不同音素变化的多行。
And the third col n will be also the same again for all of those, and again there will be the same grapheme form.	第三列也是一样的，也有同样的字形。
So that is when the language model sees.	这就是语言模型看到的。
And I think that this way, these systems should be able to load it.	我认为这样的话，这些系统应该能够加载它。
And you will also possibly run into one more problem: that it is not ready for two big custom dictionaries.	你可能还会遇到另一个问题：它还不能容纳两个大的自定义词典。
So, this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the two of you together.	所以，这也是需要测试的东西，但是请你们两个一起测试。
So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary.	因此 [PERSON2] 知道他在字典中创建了什么。
And you know what the dictionary looks like when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together.	当你手动创建字典时，你知道它是什么样子，你需要把这两个知识放在一起。
Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.	啊，这样它就可以和生成的字典一起工作了。
(PERSON4) Okay.	[PERSON4] 好的。
(PERSON6) So [PERSON2], does this make sense?	[PERSON6] 那么 [PERSON2]，这有意义吗？
(PERSON2) Yeah, sure, we'll discuss it.	[PERSON2] 是的，当然，我们会讨论的。
(PERSON6) Yeah, so is there anything else, [PERSON2], that you have?	[PERSON6] 是的，那么 [PERSON2] 您还有什么其他的吗？
(PERSON2) Well, maybe interesting information for Dominik.	[PERSON2] 对 Dominik 来说，这可能是个有趣的信息。
I'm finishing training of a German ASR that may be used for time stamping.	我正在完成一台德国 ASR 的训练，它可能会被用来做时间标记。
I'm not sure how good it will be because I'm trying to do it on (Libry) Speech.	我不确定它会有多好，因为我正试图在（自由的）演讲中做到这一点。
And, though, when I was downloading it, they claimed it had more than 600 hours.	然而，当我下载它的时候，他们声称它已经超过 600 小时了。
But then the training said that the actual training set contained only around 300 hours.	但后来培训说，实际的培训集只包含大约 300 个小时。
And I'm still not sure whether these 300 hours do not contain similar sentences.	而且我还不确定这 300 个小时是否不包含类似的句子。
Or actually the same sentences but spoken by different speakers.	或者实际上是相同的句子，但是由不同的说话者说出。
For example, in English or Czech I used to observe steeper conversions.	例如，在英语或捷克语中，我曾经观察到差异更大的转换。
And now it won't convert so fast.	而且现在也不会转换那么快了。
So, if we take some samples during the training.	所以如果我们在训练中采集一些样本。
Then there are still some serious errors in the ASR output.	那么在 ASR 输出中仍然有一些严重的错误。
So, I'm hopeful that for the time stamping, it is good enough.	所以，我希望对于时间戳来说，它已经足够好了。
Or at least we might try it.	或者至少我们可以试试。
(PERSON17) Okay, that's good, yeah.	[PERSON17] 好的，很好。
So, I started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you reminded me, [PERSON8], that your profanity filtering is not yet integrated.	所以，我开始了，但我认为我从未完成给你的电子邮件，因为你提醒我，[PERSON8]，你提到的脏话过滤尚未集成。
And I think this is also an important message for [PERSON5], who has disappeared again from the call.	我认为这对 [PERSON5] 来说也是一个重要的信息，他已经从通话中消失了。
So, the important message is that yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated, and everybody should do so.	因此，重要的信息是，是的，你在积极推动，以便整合你的结果，这很好，每个人都应该这样做。
And at the same time, we need to have the setup, so that you can actually integrate and test it yourself.	与此同时，我们需要设置，以便您可以实际集成并自己测试。
So, I call it "do-it-yourself integration".	所以，我称之为“自己动手整合”。
So, [PERSON8], when working with [PERSON5] and when documenting what the setups are, make sure it is tested well enough by colleagues, such as [PERSON4] or even [PERSON9] for the language model checks and everybody else.	因此，[PERSON8]，在使用 [PERSON5] 和记录设置时，确保同事对其进行了足够好的测试，例如 [PERSON4] 甚至 [PERSON9] 语言模型检查和其他所有人。
So, whenever someone develops a new useful component, the full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily, so he can test it himself.	因此，每当有人开发一个新的有用的组件时，他应该可以相当容易地访问完整的管道，这样他就可以自己测试它。
So, this do-it-yourself integration is important, because otherwise it will all remain on you, [PERSON8], and you don't want to be overloaded.	因此，这种“自己动手”的整合非常重要，因为否则这一切都将由您来承担，[PERSON8]，而您不想超负荷工作。
So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first testing approach, which has already been done.	因此，您希望为这些人提供输入和输出，作为第一个测试方法，这已经完成了。
[PERSON4], right?	[PERSON4]，对吗？
The profanity filtering, has it been tested on logs?	脏话过滤，在日志上测试过吗？
I think it was.	我认为测试过。
(PERSON8) Yeah, it was tested on logs, I think.	[PERSON8] 是的，我想是在原木上进行了测试。
So, now it's time to test it on the live pipelines.	所以，现在是时候在管道上测试了。
And again, I think it's better if [PERSON8] explains to [PERSON4] how to do it, so that [PERSON4] runs it for himself some of the workers and live playing some of the problematic file like using [PROJECT8] or whatever.	同样，我认为最好是 [PERSON8] 向 [PERSON4] 解释如何操作，以便 [PERSON4] 为自己的一些员工运行它，并现场播放一些有问题的文件，如使用 [PROJECT8] 或其他方式。
Simply play them.	简单地播放它们。
Follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works.	跟随机器上的声音输出，看看它是如何工作的。
Because only when doing the real setup will the true errors appear.	因为只有在进行真正的设置时，才会出现真正的错误。
It is important to first debug it, using the log files, and then it's important to debug it in the pipeline.	重要的是首先使用日志文件调试它，然后在管道中调试它。
And if this debugging can be done by the author of that component, here, in this case [PERSON4], it would be most efficient for all of us.	如果这种调试可以由该组件的作者来完成，在这种情况下 [PERSON4]，对我们所有人来说都是最高效的。
So, [PERSON8], please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do-it-yourself integration.	因此，[PERSON8]，请确认您同意这种类似于自己动手整合的想法。
(PERSON17) Yeah, so for the multi-accent English.	[PERSON17] 是的，对于多口音的英语来说确实如此。
So, we are now [PERSON14] putting that together to just one technical solution.	因此，我们现在 [PERSON14] 将这些整合成一个技术解决方案。
The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers.	[PERSON14] 目前的想法是，他将使用其他句子中的单词来创建新的句子，并且他将在不同的说话者之间执行此操作。
So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved.	因此，这将是真正的多说话者句子，因此对这些说话者的不同口音的鲁棒性也可以得到提高。
Ah, so that's one particle experiment.	嗯，这是一个粒子实验。
And later on, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing.	稍后，我们可能会做一些关于多重口音的事情。
So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment.	所以，这些新句子实际上会尝试用一个实验解决两个问题。
One problem is the implicit language model.	一个问题是隐式语言模型。
So, the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences.	因此，ASR 系统必须看到尽可能多的句子。
And we are going to create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part to that, so that the language model will be better for the ASR, and the robustness to different speakers would be also better.	我们将通过在纯文本语言模型中添加声音部分来创建新的句子，这样语言模型将更适合 ASR，并且对不同说话者的鲁棒性也将更好。
And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea.	在昨天的一次演讲中，我听到了另一个想法。
It was during the training.	是在训练的时候。
They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound.	他们从声音中去掉了时间带和频率带。
So, they were training on disrupted inputs, and that also greatly improved the robustness of the system.	因此，他们正在对中断的输入进行训练，这也极大地提高了系统的鲁棒性。
(PERSON17) Anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing.	[PERSON17] 任何人都可以练习非母语口音。
Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document.	好的，我注意到的另一件事是，这在周一的试卷中。
It is highlighted four times.	它被突出显示四次。
So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session.	因此，当某个会话发生时，我们需要该会话的名称和术语。
And we need to collect it, prepare it manually, create it somewhat.	我们需要收集，手动准备，并进行创建。
And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible.	并且这种手工创建应该尽可能地得到自动化工具的支持。
So, there is a certain skill b in that, which needs to be practiced.	所以，这里面有某种技能 b，需要练习。
So, I'm quite skilled at shuffling text files.	所以，我很擅长混洗文本文件。
And whenever I see any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head of what could be done faster.	每当我看到你们中的任何一个人这样做的时候，我的脑海中总会有一些提示，告诉我什么可以做得更快。
Maybe it is not faster for your end, but at least you should consider it.	也许这对你来说不是很快，但至少你应该考虑一下。
So there this skill is something that that we need people to have.	所以这是我们需要人们具备的技能。
And we need someone to be responsible for that.	我们需要有人对此负责。
And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be [PERSON8].	恐怕这个职位的唯一人选就是 [PERSON8]。
If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so.	如果你找到其他人愿意帮助立即进行域适应和数据处理，请告知。
And then we need -	然后我们需要 -
So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems.	因此，一旦我们获得了术语词典和任何单词发音，我们就需要将这些词典用于系统的技术。
So, my impression from the domain adaptation that [PERSON9] has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR.	因此，我对 [PERSON9] 在所有会议中精心进行的领域调整的印象是，它在混合 ASR 中并不明显。
So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday.	因此，这样的会议将在本周一再次举行。
[PERSON9] is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT5] set up.	[PERSON9] 已经开始收集数据，但我希望在 [PROJECT5] 设置中看到该领域调整的好处。
So, maybe [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and [PERSON14], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT5].	因此，可能是 [PERSON9] 和 [PERSON8]，因为他正在学习如何进行领域调整，也可能是 [PERSON14]，因为他正在学习如何使用 [PROJECT5]。
If you three could meet and double check what is [PROJECT5] doing with the -	如果你们三个能见面并仔细检查一下 [PROJECT5] 在做什么 -
It's not [PROJECT5], actually, the domain adaptation is for the [PERSON18] toolkit, right.	不是 [PROJECT5]，实际上，领域适应是针对 [PERSON18] 工具包的，对吧。
So, this is kind of backward-looking, making sure that the old approach works.	所以，这是一种回顾，确保旧的方法有效。
At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR.	目前，为全神经 ASR 做任何域适应是绝对不可能的。
So, what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting from sound and some merging procedure.	所以，我正在考虑的是有一个独立的从声音中识别关键词和一些合并程序。
So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time.	因此，我们可以同时运行两个 ASR。
End-to-end ASR, which is better in general.	端到端的 ASR，一般来说哪个更好。
And then domain-adapted [PROJECT5] setup, which is used only to spot the keywords.	然后是适用于域的 [PROJECT5] 设置，它仅用于识别关键字。
And when we see a keyword in the domain-adapted version then we would then we would use that sentence from [PROJECT5], which is in general worse, but contains the right terms.	当我们在领域适应版本中看到一个关键字时，我们会使用 [PROJECT5] 中的句子，这通常更差，但包含正确的术语。
So that's my suggestion of what we could do.	这就是我对我们能做些什么的建议。
And another suggestion is that we really should have our own fully neural ASR and do various experiments on finetuning and all that.	另一个建议是，我们真的应该有自己的全神经 ASR，并做各种微调等实验。
So, we have discussed this with [PERSON14].	因此，我们与 [PERSON14] 讨论了此事。
And, [PERSON14], is there any update from the potential colleague or friend of yours?	[PERSON14]，您的潜在同事或朋友有什么新消息吗？
(PERSON17) Yeah, so if there is anyone else who'd be curious about this please let me know or get in touch.	[PERSON17] 是的，如果还有人对此感兴趣，请告诉我或与我联系。
So, it's this is something which is which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet.	所以，这是一篇真正被广泛接受的论文，因为人们还没有这样做。
And that's the most urgent problem these days.	这是目前最紧迫的问题。
So, we really could make an impact there.	所以，我们真的可以在那里产生影响。
(PERSON6) Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about like what kinds of data we currently use for this, because, for example, like if you check like [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5] that they are like already pretty good at these things -	[PERSON6] 是的，我可能只是在想我们目前在这方面使用什么样的数据，因为，例如，如果您在 [ORGANIZATION5] 上查看 [ORGANIZATION4] 的模型，他们似乎已经很擅长这些事情了
(PERSON6) And I think that if we just like -	[PERSON6] 我认为，如果我们只是想要-
We could probably just get the data from them, because you have like a such a large set of videos basically with different domains and different speaker native languages on [ORGANIZATION5].	我们可能只是从他们那里获取数据，因为 [ORGANIZATION5] 上有这么大一组视频，基本上来自不同的领域和不同的母语使用者。
And I had this idea that we could just like use some tool to download basically some kinds of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make training tests a training set out of them.	我有一个想法，我们可以使用一些工具从 [ORGANIZATION5] 下载一些经过过滤的视频，然后根据这些视频进行训练测试。
So, I plan to do it myself.	那么，我打算自己做。
I plan to go there, but we need a backup person.	我计划去那里，但是我们需要一个后援。
And also, for the [PROJEC210] event we need someone to take care of the recording,	此外，对于 [PROJEC210] 活动，我们需要有人负责录音，
So, the archiver person, so that we don't lose that session again.	因此，归档者，这样我们就不会再次丢失该会话。
And the more important and still persisting topic to work on is ladder climbing.	更重要且仍在坚持的主题是爬梯。
And I've suggested here in the paragraph for [PERSON2] that we could use simple html tables that would be autogenerated and that that would grow.	我在 [PERSON2] 的段落中建议，我们可以使用简单的 html 表格，这些表格可以自动生成，并且会不断增长。
I think that that would be probably the easiest to just put up the tables as html, but it could get difficult when we want to see the differences, as new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign.	我认为这可能是最简单的方法，只是把表格做成 html 格式，但是当我们想要看到不同之处时，这可能会变得很困难，因为新的系统将在每个新的评估活动后进行评估。
It may be difficult to prepare these tables.	可能很难准备这些桌子。
So, I asked [PERSON7] and [PERSON7] unfortunately won't be available during this call.	因此，我询问了 [PERSON7] 和 [PERSON7]，很遗憾，他们在此次通话中不在。
To tell us whether [ORGANISATION242], which is a web-based solution.	告诉我们 [ORGANISATION242]，这是一个基于 web 的解决方案。
Some start-up company which offers accounts for academic purposes for free.	一些初创公司免费提供学术用途的账户。
If that would help us or not.	不管这对我们有没有帮助。
Okay, so [ORGANISATION242] is not recommended by [PERSON7].	好的，所以 [PERSON7] 不推荐 [ORGANISATION242]。
So, simple html is probably the way to go.	所以，简单的 html 可能是最好的方法。
So, as soon as [PERSON2] has these evaluations m cleaned up.	所以，一旦 [PERSON2] 清理完这些评估。
So, that means moving the few scripts to where they belong from [PROJECT3] test set and some automatic runner.	因此，这意味着将一些脚本从 [PROJECT3] 测试集和一些自动运行程序中移到它们应该在的地方。
Then also please create a conversion from the tables into html similar to the tech conversion and then put these results regularly to your webpage.	然后，也请创建一个从表格到 html 的转换类似于技术转换，然后把这些结果定期到您的网页。
Or what you could even do is to have a full git check out directly located in this public html or singling from that public html.	或者你甚至可以直接在这个公共 html 中或者从那个公共 html 中挑选出一个完整的 git check out。
So that it would be immediately accessible through the web, and anybody could have a look at the current scorings and explore that.	这样就可以通过网络立即访问，任何人都可以查看当前的评分并进行探索。
So, this would be useful, especially for m people outside of [ORGANISATION2] such as, [ORGANISATION15].	因此，这将非常有用，尤其是对于 [ORGANISATION2] 之外的 m 个人，例如 [ORGANISATION15]。
We know they have like -	我们知道他们有 -
The performance was bad for some of the files, and they could directly m browse it on the web m.	一些文件的性能很差，他们可以直接在网上浏览。
They could also browse it actually in on [ORGANISATION101].	他们也可以在 [ORGANISATION101] 上浏览。
This is up to you to set it up so that it's user-friendly and easy to follow.	这是由你来设置，以便它的用户友好和易于遵循。
(PERSON2) Okay, I'll do that.	[PERSON2] 好的，我会的。
(PERSON11) Yeah, thanks.	[PERSON11] 好的，谢谢。
I'm now working on, or getting to update, the demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I'm not mistaken.	我现在正在工作，或者说正在更新提交的演示论文，如果我没弄错的话，该论文将于下周五提交。
And then I have some project reports to do and I'm starting to gather documents - like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions.	然后我有一些项目报告要做，我开始为两个会议收集文件，比如，或者文件的链接，还不是文件本身。
(PERSON11) <parallel_talk> For ASR as well we should add a complimentary metric -	[PERSON11] <parallel_talk> 对于 ASR，我们也应该添加一个补充指标-
Actually more, we should add complementary met- these complementary metrics. </parallel_talk>	实际上，我们应该添加补充性的度量——这些补充性的度量。</parallel_talk>
So, you mentioned one and that is profanity filtering m evaluation.	所以，你提到了一个，那就是脏话过滤。
So <parallel_talk> have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output </parallel_talk>, right?	因此 <parallel_talk> 有一个不得出现在输出中的明确列表 </parallel_talk>，对吗？
<parallel_talk> And then rare words evaluation.	<parallel_talk> 然后是生僻字评价。
And here have an explicit list of names and terms that we do want to appear in the output, scored not simply by (order) rate </parallel_talk> but scored by something which directly accounts these things, right?	这里有一个我们希望出现在输出中的名称和术语的明确列表，不仅按（订单）率 </parallel_talk> 评分，而且按直接说明这些内容的内容评分，对吗？
Yes, so I totally agree.	是的，所以我完全同意。
This involves also manual preparation of the reference.	这也包括手动准备参考。
So, <parallel_talk> both need manually created references. </parallel_talk>	因此，<parallel_talk> 都需要手动创建参考。</parallel_talk>
I have one remark from [PERSON1].	我有一句来自 [PERSON1] 的评论。
So <parallel_talk> [PERSON1] has compiled some translation dictionary.	因此 <parallel_talk> [PERSON1] 编写了一些翻译词典。
And she should share it soon. </parallel_talk>	她应该很快就会分享了。</parallel_talk>
So, this could become an empty part of the second thing of the rare word -	所以，这可能会成为生僻字的第二个东西的空白部分-
So <parallel_talk> this would be the rare word evaluation for MT and then from [PROJEC210] we are also likely to get some dictionary. </parallel_talk>	因此 <parallel_talk> 这将是机器翻译的罕见单词评估，然后从 [PROJEC210] 我们也可能得到一些字典。</parallel_talk>
So that would be the [PROJEC210] domain obviously.	显然，这就是 [PROJEC210] 领域。
And [PERSON2], could I ask you to revise the <unintelligible/> domain and create such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs.	[PERSON2]，我能否请您修改 <unintelligible/> 领域，通过查看输出以及输出中缺少的内容来创建这样一个字典。
So, like shortlisting - listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the <unintelligible/> domain.	所以，就像入围名单一样，列出 <unintelligible/> 领域中我们喜欢和不喜欢的词。
Could you do that?	你能做到吗？
(PERSON11) It should be doable, so let's give it a try.	[PERSON11] 这应该是可行的，所以让我们试一试。
It would be like - it would be great if you managed to do that.	如果你能做到这一点，那就太好了。
So, I'll write it down.	所以，我写下来。
So, <parallel_talk> aiming towards [ORGANISATION62] deadline with subtitler study paper. </parallel_talk>	因此，<parallel_talk> 瞄准 [ORGANISATION62] 带字幕的研究论文的截止日期。</parallel_talk>
Yes <parallel_talk> and then then a multi-source with [PERSON7] or based upon [PERSON7] or - </parallel_talk>	是 <parallel_talk>，然后是具有 [PERSON7] 或基于 [PERSON7] 或 - </parallel_talk> 的多种原文
And for the language ID, I'm curious how do you want to integrate it exactly because it already involves considering multiple ASR sources, multiple channels, so what would be the use case for the for the language ID?	对于语言 ID，我很好奇您到底想如何集成它，因为它已经涉及到考虑多个 ASR 源、多个渠道，那么语言 ID 的使用情形是什么呢？
How do we plug that in?	我们怎么把它插上？
(PERSON13) It will be audio to text worker, and it will emit time stamps like for four or two second window and the class.	[PERSON13] 它将为文字工作者提供音频，并将为四两秒钟的窗口和课程发出时间戳。
<unintelligible/> silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it in the pipeline.	<unintelligible/> 沉默、捷克语、德语、英语，然后我会告诉其他人他们想如何在管道中使用它。
(PERSON11) That is important.	[PERSON11] 这很重要。
Please write this down here into the documenter this <unintelligible/> summary, because that is for [PERSON2].	请在此处将此记录到文档管理员的 <unintelligible/> 总结中，因为这是 [PERSON2] 的总结。
And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and also possibly [PERSON5].	还有 [PERSON2]，当您与 [PERSON10] 交谈时，也可能是 [PERSON5]。
If we have this tool, we need to (ship) the audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers <unintelligible/>	如果我们有这个工具，我们需要将音频（发送）给多个 ASR 或多个员工 <unintelligible/>
We will separately need to (ship) the audio to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/>	例如，根据 <other_noise/>，我们需要分别将音频（发送）给英国 ASR、德国 ASR 和捷克 ASR
And also, to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is tool which we do not have yet.	还有，对于这个语言 ID 工作者，然后我们需要合并这些输出，这是我们还没有的工具。
That's the multi-source tool, which will be observing the text outputs and also following the time stamps and it would emit the - it would probably like produce the output into three separate language channels for using either silence or the correct ASR.	这是一个多源工具，它将观察文本输出，并跟踪时间戳，它可能会将输出发送到三个独立的语言通道，以使用静音或正确的 ASR。
So, we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent if it's the wrong language and it is the recognized text if it's the correct language.	所以，我们需要一个 ASR 的过滤器，这样 ASR 在语言错误的情况下是无声的，而在语言正确的情况下是可识别的文本。
I just made it up this type of setup.	我刚刚做了这种设置。
Another of setup would be that same sound is shipped to ASR and this language checker.	另一个设置是相同的声音被发送到 ASR 和这个语言检查器。
This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR, silencing the ASR if it's the wrong language.	这个语言检查器本质上是 ASR 的一部分，如果它是错误的语言，就使 ASR 静音。
That's also an option.	这也是一种选择。
So, we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes.	因此，我们需要找出哪种集成语言 ID 的方式最适合我们的目的。
So, please keep thinking about this like what are our pipelines.	所以，请继续思考这个问题，比如我们的管道是什么。
Ideally, I think that the least like management confusion and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual.	理想情况下，我认为如果我们的机器翻译模型是多语言的，那么最不像管理混乱之类的问题就会出现。
If they supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English.	如果他们支持不同的源语言，并从这些语言翻译成英语。
Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input, so we would have multi-lingual multiple ASRs at the beginning.	如果英语作为输入，可能只是复制，所以我们在开始时会有多种语言的多个 ASR。
All going into English, and then from the English will go into all of the languages.	所有的都变成英语，然后从英语变成所有的语言。
And later when [PERSON12] would have multi-lingual model of ASR, that language ID would not even be needed.	后来，当 [PERSON12] 拥有多语言 ASR 模型时，甚至不再需要该语言 ID。
(PERSON3) The thing is, as long as we do the analysis more properly, one thing is the possible adversarial evaluation, just to indicate that that the constraints are actually having an impact on the actual output.	[PERSON3] 问题是，只要我们更恰当地进行分析，就可以得出可能的对立评估，这只是为了表明限制因素实际上对实际产出产生了影响。
That that would be nice and yeah possibly the attention analysis.	那会很好，可能是注意力分析。
But I'm not sure it might give us the same answers, basically, if the if the model attends or does not attend to the constraint.	但我不确定它会给我们相同的答案，基本上，如果模型考虑或不考虑约束。
(PERSON4) I had to look just at a few examples of attention, I did not do any statistics or anything, and it looks at the constraints, and when it translates the constraints, it looks like the constraints given, and I think it would be useful if the system made any errors, but it in fact does not do any in that sense.	[PERSON4] 我只看了几个注意力的例子，我没有做任何统计或任何事情，它查看约束条件，当它翻译约束条件时，它看起来像给定的约束条件，我认为如果系统出现任何错误，将是有用的，但实际上系统没出现错误。
It makes some general translation errors but not the (phenomena) we are trying to solve.	它犯了一些一般性的翻译错误，但不是我们试图解决的（现象）。
Well, going back to the automatic evaluation, the problem with mismatch is that the output is correctly inflected, but the context is different.	好吧，回到自动评估，不匹配的问题是输出正确屈折，但上下文不同。
Therefore, it is not the same word form as in reference, right?	所以和参考文献里不是一个词形吧？
(PERSON4) Yeah, but I have also checked if the contexts are valid translations and in most cases they are.	[PERSON4] 是的，但我也检查了上下文是否是有效的翻译，在大多数情况下都是有效的。
Like in the first 100 examples that were marked as error by automatic evaluation 91 of them were correctly inflected in correct contexts.	与前 100 个被自动评估标记为错误的例子一样，其中 91 个在正确的上下文中被正确地变形。
(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the incorrect context, like the translation was wrong.	[PERSON4] 我认为只有两三个句子在不正确的上下文中出现了正确的词形变化，比如翻译错误。
And then there are some cases where the translation was totally wrong, because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be <unintelligible/>, but that was just like one or two cases.	还有一些翻译完全错误的情况，因为句子确实是错的，部分肯定是 <unintelligible/>，但这只是一两种情况。
(PERSON3) But you are trying to match the divert forms when you are evaluating it, right?	[PERSON3] 但您在评估时会尝试匹配分流表，对吗？
You do not do any-	你不做任何 -
(PERSON3) -lemmatization of the reference and the-	[PERSON3] - 参考文献的术语化和 -
(PERSON4) Both, both, both, I'm matching both the surface forms and lemma.	[PERSON4] 两者，两者，两者，我正在匹配表面形式和引理。
(PERSON3) Oh I see, oh yeah, those are the two scores, right?	[PERSON3] 哦，我明白了，哦，对了，这是两个分数，对吗？
(PERSON4) It is just the dilemma score for the (European?) is not in the table because of the table like won't fit into the paper so <unintelligible/>	[PERSON4] 只是（欧洲？）的两难分数不在表中，因为表格像放不进纸里，所以 <unintelligible/>。
Coverage is always like 97 percent.	覆盖率总是在 97% 左右。
It just generates the correct lemmas, just-	它只是生成正确的引理，只是-
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, okay, I get it, I get it.	[PERSON3] 哦，好的，我明白了，我明白了。
So basically, the lemma coverage says whether the constraint is there, and the surface coverage difference suggests that it might be incorrectly inflected, but that is not the case.	所以基本上，引理覆盖表示约束是否存在，表面覆盖的差异表明它可能被错误地弯曲，但事实并非如此。
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, just I do not know if you if you, if you catch <unintelligible/> when we were talking about [PERSON1],	[PERSON3] 哦，是的，只是我不知道您是否了解 <unintelligible/> 当我们谈到 [PERSON1] 时，
but one thing, is, that, that the (blow) is better but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually properly inflected manually,	但有一件事是，（blow）更好，但另一件事是词条实际上是手动正确屈折的，
but that is that is another, no, no problem, it is actually good that is <unintelligible/> right, yeah.	但这是另一个问题，没关系，这实际上很好 <unintelligible/>，没错。
So, I was thinking there might be.	所以，我在想也许有。
But I'm not sure whether we have some test data for that, but we might try to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer?	但我不确定我们是否有这方面的测试数据，但我们可能会试着在模型上做一些风格转换？
As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, what is the difference between the outputs.	如你所知，我们可以使用一个约束，试着用一个同义的约束来代替，看看或者比较输出之间有什么不同。
But this is, like I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself do not have an exact idea how to do it, but it might have been an interesting, distinct scenario.	但这就像我只是模糊地描述它，因为我自己也不知道如何去做，但这可能是一个有趣且独特的场景。
I do not know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English Czech? Do we have something?	我不知道，[PERSON1]，您知道英语捷克语的任何风格转换数据吗？我们有什么发现吗？
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>	[PERSON4] <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) By style transfer, Dusan, you mean that there would be something which is in the written language, and you would be the target side, would be in the spoken language or something like that?	[PERSON1] Dusan，你说的风格转移是指书面语言中会有一些东西，而你会是目标方，会是口语或类似的东西？
(PERSON3) Well, that is the thing like, I have only a limited knowledge about the task.	[PERSON3] 嗯，我对这项任务的了解有限。
But I can imagine that you want to rewrite a sentence that it is not written by male, but it is written by a female instead or, I do not know, like you can have a scientific and unscientific explanation of certain phenomena.	但是我可以想象，你想重写一个句子，不是男性写的，而是女性写的，或者，我不知道，就像你可以对某些现象做出科学和不科学的解释。
I'm not really that familiar with the exact data sets and what they cover.	我对确切的数据集及其涵盖的内容并不太熟悉。
And the idea is that the style of the sentences gets quite vaguely defined.	这个想法是，句子的风格变得非常模糊。
So again, not so sure.	所以还是不太确定。
(PERSON1) We have this corpus of sentence transformations.	[PERSON1] 我们有这个句子转换语料库。
And one thing that is there and could be labelled as style transfer is for example, making the sentences more general.	有一件事可以被称为风格转移，例如，使句子更加概括。
So, details are omitted, the sentence is simplified, and then making the sentence sound colloquial.	所以，细节被省略，句子被简化，然后使句子听起来口语化。
Well, just a paraphrase.	嗯，只是一个释义。
And I'm not sure if we have anything like shortening of the sentence.	我不确定我们是否有缩短句子的方法。
For shortening, Matous is doing some experiment with English–Czech, but we do not have any reference data there.	为了缩短，Matous 正在用英语-捷克语做一些实验，但是我们在那里没有任何参考数据。
So, we do not have any sentence compression dataset.	因此，我们没有任何句子压缩数据集。
So maybe the generalization could be of interest but I'm afraid that there are too many different good generalizations, so the single reference one would be too limited to tell you anything about the quality of your generalization.	因此，也许归纳可能是令人感兴趣的，但我担心有太多不同的好的归纳，所以单个参考将过于有限，无法告诉您任何关于您的归纳质量的信息。
And I'm not aware of any like gender transformations, for example, this could be done <unintelligible/> for Czech, so maybe the right person would be Rudolf Rosa to ask him if he has ever generated any such dataset.	我不了解所有类似的性别角色转换，例如，这可能是为捷克人做的 <unintelligible/>，所以可能合适的人是 Rudolf Rosa，问他是否曾经生成过任何这样的数据集。
So, there will be a root-based generation of some sentence counterpart.	所以，会有一些句子对应物的基于词根的生成。
(PERSON3) I guess that is actually like an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of the like gender of the speaker in the in the translation.	[PERSON3] 我想这实际上是一个有趣的问题，我们是否可以使用约束条件来加强翻译中说话者的这种相似性别。
(PERSON1) That is actually a very good idea.	[PERSON1] 这实际上是一个非常好的主意。
So, we could focus on that and create a particular sub-part of [PROJECT1] test set that would cover that.	因此，我们可以关注这一点，并创建 [PROJECT1] 测试集的一个特定子部分来涵盖这一点。
Ah so that we sometimes we know the gender of the speaker so if you are...  maybe I'll share the screen and browse that.	嗯，所以我们有时知道说话者的性别，所以如果你是...  也许我会分享屏幕并浏览它。
(PERSON8) Or I tried it with Marian just attending it and it's... I don't know how many BLEU points lower.	[PERSON8] 或者我试着让 Marian 参加，结果...不知道低了多少 BLEU 点。
(PERSON2) Because like the way I believe Martin does his <unintelligible/> little translation, so he translates more sentences at once and then picks only the centre one and goes like this for the whole document.	[PERSON2] 因为我相信 Martin 很喜欢他的 <unintelligible/> 小翻译方式，所以他一次翻译更多的句子，然后只选择中间的句子，对整个文档都是这样。
So, the context is like in one <unintelligible/> together with sentence we actually want to translate.	因此，上下文就像是一个 <unintelligible/> 我们实际上想要翻译的句子。
(PERSON10) Yeah, I think - wasn't it Dominik doing some experiments with Ivana?	[PERSON10] 是的，我想 Dominik 不是在和 Ivana 一起做实验吗？
I think the last year or two years ago for double empty where they were attending the context or concatenating the context with input sentence and doing some sort of document level translation.	我想是去年或两年前双方都有空，他们在那里关注上下文，或者将上下文与输入句子连接起来，做一些文档级的翻译。
But the thing is with this with the concatenation is not completely sure whether it has the same effect as we do multi encoder setting-	但问题是，这种拼接并不能完全确定它是否具有与我们设置多编码器相同的效果
(PERSON1) Like everybody is different, it's definitely a different calculation, different leader, but it's I'm surprised that [PERSON8] says that it doesn't work full stop.	[PERSON1] 就像每个人都是不同的一样，这肯定是不同的计算方法，不同的领导者，但我很惊讶 [PERSON8] 说它完全不起作用。
(PERSON8) Yeah, okay, so sorry, maybe I should be more correct that it didn't work like in the way I did it <laugh/>	[PERSON8] 是的，好吧，很抱歉，也许我应该更正确地说，它不像我做的那样工作 <laugh/>
(PERSON1) Yeah, because I think it's a method which is very easy to test, and it always should be tested in contrast with the two encoders, and I would expect sometimes to be better and sometimes to be worse than the two encoders set up, depending on the exact task like what exactly is the second thing that you are encoding.	[PERSON1] 是的，因为我认为这是一种非常容易测试的方法，并且总是应该用两种编码器进行对比测试，我预计有时会比两种编码器设置得更好，有时会更差，这取决于具体的任务，例如您要编码的第二件东西到底是什么。
So, maybe if you have two copies two paraphrases of the same sentence,	所以，如果你有两个副本，同一个句子的两种解释，
maybe it is somehow confusing for the attention so whatever, I don't know.	也许这有点让人迷惑，所以不管怎样，我不知道。
Behaviour also could be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods, compared to transformer, so for RNN then it behaved differently maybe with transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train so maybe you need to whatever increase warm-ups number, warm-up sets.	与 transformer 相比，旧的序列到序列方法的行为也可能有所不同，所以对于 RNN 来说，它的行为有所不同，可能 transformer 更难训练，所以可能你需要增加热身次数和热身次数。
(PERSON2) Yeah, so just know like-	[PERSON2] 是的，所以就像-
(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly but this is like what-	[PERSON8] 我不记得了，所以我记不太清了，但这就像是-
when I started in summer with those multi-source experiments.	当我在夏天开始做那些多源实验时。
The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and source and maybe I, I don't remember now,	我开始做的第一件事是连接释义和出处，也许我，我现在不记得了，
I can check it till the next meeting whether I tried also,	我可以等到下次开会时再检查我是否也试过，
I definitely tried when the sources are on the first position then some delimiter and the paraphrase on the second position.	我明确地尝试了当源在第一个位置，然后一些定界符和释义在第二个位置。
I might have also tried that I shuffled the two things randomly, yeah, and I just remember that it did abundantly this compenetration stuff and tried multi-encoders.	我可能也尝试过随机打乱这两件事，是的，我只记得它做了大量的这种补偿工作，并尝试了多编码器。
(PERSON8) And it was probably due to low scores.	[PERSON8] 这可能是因为分数低。
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> that you like can improve your amenity score by just appending phrase-based output and the attention is like double diagonal, so the attention is not an issue, so like I believe you but it's surprising that it didn't work.	[PERSON2] <unintelligible/> 您喜欢的产品可以通过添加基于短语的输出来提高您的舒适度得分，注意力就像是双对角线，所以注意力不是问题，所以我相信您，但令人惊讶的是它不起作用。
(PERSON10) So, if you if you input the phrase-based output that's basically post editing, right? You can think about it as a postediting like you are postediting phrase-based output, right? Or like depends on the point of view, right?	[PERSON10] 所以，如果你输入基于短语的输出，基本上是后期编辑，对吗？你可以把它想象成后期编辑，就像你正在后期编辑基于短语的输出一样，对吗？或者说喜欢取决于观点，对吧？
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> that you like fully to rewrite it but technically it fits exactly the postediting task, you can plug this as a solution to the postediting task.	[PERSON1] <unintelligible/> 您完全喜欢重写它，但从技术上来说，它完全适合后期编辑任务，您可以将其作为后期编辑任务的解决方案。
(PERSON10) Okay, so one question just for me just to make sure in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence separator token, right?	[PERSON10] 好的，我想问一个问题，以确保在串联设置中插入了句子分隔符，对吗？
You have a special token to distinguish like which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence or do you just concatenate them without anything?	你有一个特殊的记号来区分哪个是源，哪个是上下文，或者是另一个句子，或者你只是把它们连接起来，没有任何东西？
And hope that the system learns it?	并希望系统学会它？
(PERSON8) I tried to, I guess two tokens and yeah like because in the first version, we had a suspicion that the token could be also tokenized itself, so then I replayed it with another token which is not only for this purpose because we used some pretrained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain separator tokens.	[PERSON8] 我尝试了，我猜是两个令牌，因为在第一个版本中，我们怀疑令牌本身也可以被令牌化，所以我用另一个令牌重放了它，这不仅仅是为了这个目的，因为我们使用了一些预训练的字典，而这个字典不包含分隔符令牌。
So, I used some token that I assumed that it wouldn't be like tokenized into several pieces and so it will appear once.	所以，我用了一些记号，我认为它不会像记号一样分成几部分，所以它只会出现一次。
I had no guarantee that this token couldn't appear in other places in the sentence and that is the only place it could appear.	我不能保证这个记号不会出现在句子的其他地方，这是它唯一可能出现的地方。
So, it could be done more properly, yeah, I agree.	所以，可以做得更好，是的，我同意。
(PERSON2) But the Flask part or the communication part with the client is something that I cannot do.	[PERSON2] 但 Flask 部分或与客户的沟通部分是我无法完成的。
Because I have no experience and no time to get it running.	因为我没有经验，也没有时间让它运转起来。
(PERSON1) I thought it meant something using I don't know mediator.	[PERSON1] 我认为这意味着使用了我不知道的调解器。
(PERSON2) No, make a HTTP client which can fill the queue and read from another queue.	[PERSON2] 不，创建一个可以填充队列并从另一个队列读取数据的 HTTP 客户端。
And send the text back in a HTTP request.	并在 HTTP 请求中发回文本。
Because my idea is that the user clicks be used in the Ukrainian project too.	因为我的想法是，用户点击也被用于乌克兰项目。
(PERSON2) And my idea is that a client clicks this microphone button and starts to speak, and when the user is speaking, you send the audio in small chunks at the same time.	[PERSON2] 我的想法是，客户点击这个麦克风按钮并开始讲话，当用户讲话时，您同时发送小块音频。
Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds.	比方说 200 甚至 100 毫秒。
And to the HTTP server put it to a queue which I will handle the queue later with (ASR).	并将它放入一个队列，稍后我将使用这个队列（ASR）来处理它。
And the model will do some logic, some inference with that.	这个模型会做一些逻辑，一些推论。
And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should get the partial transcript back.	每当它有一个新的副本时，它会将它发送回来，用户应该会得到部分副本。
And it should be immediately displayed in the text field.	它应该立即显示在文本字段中。
(PERSON1) I could think about that.	[PERSON1] 我可以考虑一下。
Just I don't really know Flask either, but yeah, I can think about that.	只是我也不太了解 Flask，不过我可以考虑一下。
(PERSON2) Oh maybe a different HTTP server.	[PERSON2] 哦，可能是不同的 HTTP 服务器。
I don't know, maybe we don't even need a fancy HTTP server for that.	我不知道，也许我们甚至不需要特别厉害的 HTTP 服务器。
(PERSON1) I mean for text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.	[PERSON1] 我的意思是，对于文本流，我们使用类似 Hypercore 的东西，但我不确定这是否适用。
(PERSON2) Yeah, the only requirement is that it should handle more connection at a time.	[PERSON2] 是的，唯一的要求是它应该一次处理更多的连接。
(PERSON1) Well I think online text flow is something around 2 000 at least.	[PERSON1] 我认为在线文本流量至少在 2000 左右。
(PERSON1) I mean the script that I have in two different folders, and then will run it with the little different inside workers, so that I mean, yeah, so that I have <unintelligible/> let's say ten, well instead of an output, a file by a <unintelligible/> side worker, so <unintelligible/> that we have, so I'll just make sure that these things for a single file are getting generated parallelly from all the available workers.	[PERSON1] 我指的是我放在两个不同文件夹中的脚本，然后用稍微不同的内部工作程序运行它，所以我的意思是，是的，所以我有 <unintelligible/> 比如说十个，而不是一个 <unintelligible/> 辅助工作程序的文件，所以 <unintelligible/> 我们有，所以我只需确保单个文件的这些内容是从所有可用的工作程序并行生成的。
(PERSON1) Oh that would save our time.	[PERSON1] 哦，那会节省我们的时间。
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize everything actually, parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would need to run this many times, there will be errors, you need to re-run this quickly.	[PERSON7] 是的，是的，这对于并行化所有事情非常重要，实际上，并行化系统的处理以及单元 DF 的评估，因为他需要运行多次，会有错误，您需要快速重新运行。
(PERSON7) Okay, so thanks.	[PERSON7] 好的，谢谢。
So, you are very busy with this, I don't want to put any other things on you, so let me start with the reminders.	所以，你很忙，我不想把任何其他事情放在你身上，所以让我从提醒开始。
We need to finish the description of [PROJECT1] desk set,	我们需要完成 [PROJECT1] 书桌组的描述，
Who do we have here?	我们这里有谁？
Oh well, not really, yeah, (it's done) and it's not here unfortunately.	哦，不完全是，是的，（完成了）不幸的是它不在这里。
So, this would be for [PERSON2],	因此，这是为了 [PERSON2]，
Then the evaluation, this is for [PERSON1], but we have discussed this.	然后是评估，这是针对 [PERSON1] 的，但是我们已经讨论过这个了。
Listen, give me the table in DSD let's put the fine line here and push the template of the table, like the plan structure into the delebl now, so that the numbers will come later, but I want to see some numbers and the full structure of the table very soon.	听着，给我 DSD 中的表格让我们把细线放在这里，然后把表格的模板，比如现在的计划结构，推入 delebl，这样数字会在后面出现，但是我想很快看到一些数字和表格的完整结构。
(PERSON7) Okay, thank you.	[PERSON7] 好的，谢谢您。
We have [PERSON5], that's good.	我们有 [PERSON5]，这很好。
So, for [PERSON5], I would like to check what is the progress in the evaluation of the systems, and whether you are in touch with [PERSON1] also for the evolution, which is more important.	因此，对于 [PERSON5]，我想了解一下系统评估的进展情况，以及您是否也在关注 [PERSON1] 更重要的发展。
Can you hear us, [PERSON5]?	您能听到我们吗，[PERSON5]？
(PERSON1) and then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment.	[PERSON1] 然后，我们将确定在 Petri 环境中安装哪些包。
(PERSON7) Yeah, so there's another thing,	[PERSON7] 是的，还有一件事，
Maybe it's not a good idea to combine these two runs into one setup.	也许将这两次运行合并到一个设置中并不是一个好主意。
I think it is actually better if you run it separately and save the outputs.	我认为，如果您单独运行它并保存输出，实际上会更好。
So, you first use the environment for cruise control and the processing,	所以，你首先使用巡航控制和处理的环境，
(PERSON7) and you collect all the output files, and then you run the evaluation.	[PERSON7] 收集所有输出文件，然后运行评估。
And the reason for this split is that you can paralyze more.	而这种分裂的原因就是瘫痪。
So, there will be problems on various fronts, I'm sure, and we will need the numbers very soon.	所以，我敢肯定，各方面都会有问题，我们很快就会需要这些数字。
So, if for example, some of the test files will fail for some reason,	因此，如果一些测试文件由于某种原因失败了，
Then you can still keep the translation running for the remaining ones,	然后，您仍然可以继续运行剩余的翻译，
and re-evaluate, with a sel T F, the missing ones, and, and so on.	用 sel T F 重新评估，丢失的，等等。
So, it's, the point is not to create a serial, sequential processing that includes both,	所以，关键不在于创造一个包括两者的连续的，顺序的处理过程，
but the point is to get the results, and it's actually better to do it in slices.	但重点是要得到结果，其实切片做更好。
First get all outputs, then we get all evaluations.	首先获取所有输出，然后获取所有评估。
(PERSON1) Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same.	[PERSON1] 是的，所以，我是说，现在，我也在做同样的事情。
(PERSON2) Yes, that's the only stuff I did for positive constraints.	[PERSON2] 是的，这是我为积极约束所做的唯一工作。
With the negative constraints I did something a little bit more complicated in the decoding.	有了负面的约束，我在解码时做了一些更复杂的事情。
Like filtering out the beams and replacing the beams with different beams.	比如滤除光束并用不同的光束替换光束。
And for like multi-token constraints and this kind of stuff.	比如多令牌约束之类的。
But for the positive constraints, I only compared the training approach with yeah just this very simple stuff.	但是对于积极的约束，我只比较了训练方法和这个非常简单的东西。
Just modifying the scores in each step in the same way.	只是用同样的方法修改每一步的分数。
(PERSON7) Okay, so back to the positive constraints.	[PERSON7] 好了，回到正面约束。
Were you already focusing on the analysis of the system?	你已经开始关注系统的分析了吗？
(PERSON2) Yeah, right now, I'm kind of waiting for the dataset reprocessing from ([PERSON9]).	[PERSON2] 是的，现在，我正在等待来自（[PERSON9]）的数据集重新处理。
Also [PERSON9] I had a look at the (code), and I think I know why it's so slow.	另外 [PERSON9] 我看了一下（代码），我想我知道它为什么这么慢了。
Because for each entry in the terminology in the (Europar) reprocessing, you open the dataset, tokenize it, read it line by line, tokenize it line by line and then close it.	因为对于（Europar）重新处理中的术语中的每个条目，您打开数据集，标记它，逐行读取它，逐行标记它，然后关闭它。
But you only you do that -	但是你只有你这样做-
(PERSON4) So, I remember that for [PROJECT1] I was doing this from last year from some cottage in the mountains.	[PERSON4] 所以，我记得 [PROJECT1] 我从去年开始在山里的某个小屋里做这件事。
And I just realized, shortly before New Year’s Eve that I need to submit it.	我刚刚意识到，就在新年前夕，我需要提交它。
And <laugh/> so this is also something that will happen to [PERSON8] I'm afraid that he could be...well, no party, but maybe at the remote party.	<laugh/> 所以这也是 [PERSON8] 他可能会发生的事情...嗯，没有派对，但是可能在远程派对上。
And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit it.	然后他会突然意识到他必须提交。
So, there will be no review of like at that point. <laugh/>	因此，在这一点上不会进行审查。<laugh/>
He would simply take the PDF and upload it so. <laugh/>	他会简单地把 PDF 文件上传。<laugh/>
(PERSON7) Well, okay.	[PERSON7] 嗯，好的。
So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail.	所以，是的，我会在 21 号检查，否则我会给他们发电子邮件。
(PERSON4) Please, I think better send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link in advance.	[PERSON4] 拜托，我想最好现在就给他们发一封电子邮件，提前索要链接。
(PERSON7) Okay.	[PERSON7] 好的。
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.	[PERSON4] 好的，谢谢。
(PERSON7) Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?	[PERSON7] 我们今天还有其他问题要讨论吗，或者这就是新年前的所有问题了吗？
(PERSON6) I hope there wasn’t anything for me?	[PERSON6] 我希望没有适合我的东西？
(PERSON3) Several years ago.	[PERSON3] 几年前。
MT marathons used to have this system or tool papers that were published as a special issue of PBML.	MT 马拉松曾经有这个系统或者工具论文，作为 PBML 的特刊发表。
That was in the first year when that happened.	那是第一年发生的事。
And then, in the subsequent years, it was integrated with normal like there were also PBML issues which mixed empty margin papers and separate papers because of the number of those papers.	然后，在随后的几年里，它被整合到正常的报纸中，就像也有 PBML 杂志，因为这些报纸的数量，它混合了空白纸和独立的报纸。
And we even had a thing like if the paper was not good enough for the PBML, but if the tool was presented at the MT marathon.	我们甚至有这样的事情，如果论文对 PBML 来说不够好，但是如果工具出现在 MT 马拉松上。
The authors were invited to submit for another review for one for the next PBML issue.	作者被邀请为下一期《PBML》提交另一篇评论。
So, we have, even as I said, your system, your tool is interesting.	所以，就像我说的，我们有你的系统，你的工具很有趣。
Please publish it at the MT marathon among the people.	请在 MT 马拉松上公布于众。
But your paper is too bad.	但是你的论文太差了。
You need to improve it, and you will get only to the next PBML.	你要对其进行修改，你只需到达下一个 PBML。
(PERSON4) Yes, but another possibility for SIGDial.	[PERSON4] 是的，但 SIGDial 还有另一种可能性。
Isn't it possible that trying SIGDial we attract kind of better participants.	尝试 SIGDial 有没有可能吸引更好的参与者。
(PERSON3) That's yes, that is... like I thought that I also had, but I don't know either of the venues.	[PERSON3] 是的，就是这样...就像我认为我也有，但我不知道任何一个地点。
They have final paper registration in July.	他们在七月进行期末论文注册。
So, the conference was in September, and the paper submission was in May.	所以，会议是在九月，论文提交是在五月。
Because for Interspeech, we could also like split it paper by paper.	因为对于 Interspeech，我们也可以一张纸一张纸地分开。

And some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings.	我们的一些提交文件将在 PBML 会议后提交。
And the authors would be free to choose.	作者可以自由选择。

Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event.	就像，这只是一个奖金，该文件有一些共享的任务结果出现在卫星事件。
So yeah, I think it's okay.	所以是的，我觉得没问题。
So, we do not need to ask for a special session.	因此，我们不需要要求召开特别会议。
In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that.	在 Interspeech 它被称为特别会议，我们不希望这样。
In Interspeech we want the satellite event.	在 Interspeech 中，我们想要卫星事件。
But we will tell our people.	但是我们会告诉我们的同学。
If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech.	如果你设法在 Interspeech 的截止日期前准备好了你的论文，把它作为 Interspeech 的论文发送出去，你就可以在 Interspeech 内部获取它了。

And that is for PBML.	这是给 PBML 的。
(PERSON7) Ah, okay.	[PERSON7] 好的。
But the thing is like for Interspeech satellite event.	但是事情就像 Interspeech 卫星事件一样。
Erm, Interspeech like won't get into any proceedings.	呃，类似 Interspeech 不会进入任何程序。
(PERSON2) You can I think you can just you can just reserve the whole semester just for [PERSON9]'s courses and you will have a lot of work and no free time, even though you have just one subject.	[PERSON2] 你可以，我认为你可以只保留整个学期来学习 [PERSON9] 的课程，即使你只有一个科目，你也会有很多作业，没有空闲时间。
But I think it's a different thing, because I think it's not really a thing to fail his courses.	但我认为这是另一回事，因为我认为他的课程不及格并不是事实。
Like to fail because you are unable to finish it.	类似不及格，因为你无法完成它。
Of course, like people are just giving up, but I mean it's maybe for different reason that just it's impossible to pass.	当然，就像人们放弃一样，但我的意思是，可能是因为不同的原因，不可能通过。
I think that it's definitely possible, but it's a lot of work.	我认为这肯定是可能的，但是工作量很大。
(PERSON1) Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one (??) you'll get a one.	[PERSON1] 是的，我想他在学期开始时告诉过我们，如果我们想要一个（？？）你就会得到。
Just within the second deadline, you should submit it.	就在第二个期限内，你应该提交。
That's pretty much the only thing he asked.	这差不多是他问的唯一一件事。
But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that.	但他也告诉我们，从前几年的趋势来看，很多人不会这么做。
They find it easier to read for the exam.	他们发现为考试而阅读更容易。
No, sorry, study for the exam-	不，不好意思，准备考试-
(PERSON2) Yeah because well in general, his exams are rather easy.	[PERSON2] 是的，因为总的来说，他的考试相当容易。
(PERSON2) So I wouldn't say it's super easy, because there are some courses where the exam is like fun.	[PERSON2] 所以我不会说它超级简单，因为有些课程的考试很有趣。
(PERSON1) Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me.	[PERSON1] 哦，其中一个是昨天给我的。
(PERSON2) Yeah, when it has short context and because I make decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that in, for example, a second or two, it figures out oh, well, actually this was bad translation.	[PERSON2] 是的，当它的上下文很短时，因为我是基于非常短的上下文为这种非常低的延迟做出决策的，所以它真的会做出一些事情，例如，在一两秒钟内，它就会发现哦，好吧，实际上这是非常差劲的翻译。
So, it tries to use a different wording.	因此，它试图使用不同的措辞。
To, for example, specify the thing.	例如，指定事物。
So actually, I really liked it.	所以实际上，我真的很喜欢。
I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, even though you could see that the model made mistakes on its first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction.	我喜欢一些翻译。我真的很惊讶，尽管你可以看到模型在第一次尝试时就犯了错误，但它真的想进行某种纠正。
And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is also important.	听起来非常流利，我认为这也很重要。
If you really demand low latency, then then I think that even a slightly lower quality is fine, if the fluency is good.	如果你真的要求低延迟，那么我认为即使稍微低一点的质量也可以，如果流畅度好的话。
Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think that the translation is just pointless.	因为如果你的翻译质量不好，不流畅，那么我认为翻译是没有意义的。
But if the lower quality is because the translation, if you read everything that you will get the same information, but the wording is just poor, because it used, for example, more words and it used some corrections and stuff.	但是如果质量低是因为翻译，如果你阅读所有的东西，你会得到相同的信息，但是措辞很差，因为它使用了，例如，更多的单词和一些更正和东西。
So, I think that this is completely fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't lose any information.	所以，我认为这对于同步是完全没问题的，只要你不丢失任何信息。
And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples?	哪些语言对有这些结果，比如一些例子？
Because I would like to look at it, just out of curiosity.	因为我想看看，只是出于好奇。
(PERSON2) Oh definitely, I can dump you my logs.	[PERSON2] 当然，我可以向您提供我的日志。
(PERSON7) But in which languages?	[PERSON7] 但是用哪种语言呢？
Because you know I don't speak German.	因为你知道我不会说德语。
(PERSON2) English and German.	[PERSON2] 英语和德语。
(PERSON7) Yeah, but I don't necessarily speak German <laugh/>.	[PERSON7] 是的，但我不一定会说德语 <laugh/>。
(PERSON2) Then I can provide English–Chinese and English–Japanese if it helps <laugh/>.	[PERSON2] 如果有帮助的话，我可以提供英语-汉语和英语-日语 <laugh/>。
(PERSON2) So again, I mean to make it humanly readable.	[PERSON2] 所以，我的意思是让它具有可读性。
Because this flickering is really annoying and then you lose focus on what was actually said, because maybe this is also a question of someone who knows more about the human brain and how we work with information.	因为这种闪烁真的很烦人，然后你会失去对实际所说内容的关注，因为也许这也是一个更了解人类大脑和我们如何处理信息的人的问题。
Sorry, I never thought about it in depth.	对不起，我从来没有深入思考过这个问题。
But I think that whenever I see a word, I put it into my memory and my memory is not a linear thing, but it's more like a bag.	但我认为，每当我看到一个单词，我就把它放入我的记忆中，我的记忆不是一个线性的东西，而是更像一个袋子。
So, I put a word into a bag.	所以，我把一个词放进一个袋子里。
And I like to connect the things in the bag to get the overall image of the word.	而且我喜欢把包里的东西联系起来，得到这个词的整体形象。
And I think that that's the problem with the flicker.	我认为这就是闪烁的问题。
If you translate something and then you change it, then actually I read it already, it's in my brain.	如果你翻译了某个东西，然后又修改了它，那么实际上我已经读过了，它已经在我的大脑里了。
And then I lose focus and control of what was actually then translated as correct and was not what was not.	然后我失去了注意力和控制力，不知道什么是正确的，什么是错误的。
So that's why I think that the whole flicker thing is bad and stupid by definition.	所以这就是为什么我认为整个闪烁的事情是坏的和愚蠢的定义。
Like I see the motivation, like you want to display everything you have.	就像我看到了动力，就像你想要展示你所拥有的一切。
Even though you cannot promise it's good.	即使你不能保证它是好的。
But I think that we cannot work with this extra information.	但是我认为我们不能利用这些额外的信息。
And I think that maybe the problem is that the systems are created by people working with it.	我认为问题可能在于系统是由使用它的人创建的。
If I'm a developing a system, then I'm really crazy happy if I see that even if I don't promise the translation is correct, I still show it and it's somehow good, but I think that the developer is not really focusing on the content itself.	如果我是一个开发系统的人，那么如果我看到即使我不保证翻译是正确的，我仍然展示出来，这在某种程度上是好的，但我认为开发者并没有真正关注内容本身，我会非常高兴。
And how you perceive the content, but rather that, oh yeah, my system can output it really quickly.	以及你如何理解内容，而是，哦，是的，我的系统可以很快输出它。
And even though it just guesses the quality is okay-ish, I think maybe that's why the retranslation was created.	即使它只是猜测质量还可以，我想这可能就是重译产生的原因。
Just the developers of the systems are eager to display information, and I think that because we are limited in in like the vol e of information we can perceive some time, we like see the extra information is just an extra burden for us.	只是系统的开发者渴望显示信息，我认为因为我们被限制在我们有时能感知的信息量中，我们喜欢看到额外的信息对我们来说只是一个额外的负担。
So, I think that it's not good to show extra.	所以，我认为多展示是不好的。
Like if you want to decrease latency, then instead of flicker, just lower the quality.	就像如果你想减少延迟，那么不要闪烁，只要降低质量。
I think that's still better than showing the flicker.	我认为这仍然比展示闪烁要好。
Because what would be the real use case?	因为真正的用例是什么？
Why would you need to see the unstable hypothesis, really?	为什么你需要看到不稳定假说，真的？
Like from a user perspective?	比如从用户的角度？
(PERSON1) Like technically, when human translators start translating, I mean the goal even there is for annotators, they would try to follow the speech string of the original speaker.	[PERSON1] 从技术上来说，当人工翻译人员开始翻译时，我的意思是，即使注释者有目标，他们也会尝试跟随原说话者的语音字符串。
So, there are times when they would say something, and that would be wrong, so they would just correct themselves.	所以，有时候他们会说些什么，但那是错的，所以他们会纠正自己。
(PERSON2) Well but yeah this means with my solution, like you would not do flicker, but you committed, like there is no way to change, but you correct yourself.	[PERSON2] 是的，这意味着在我的解决方案中，你不会闪烁其词，但你会做出承诺，就像没有办法改变一样，但你会纠正自己。
And that's actually what the translators are doing.	这实际上是翻译者正在做的事情。
(PERSON3) I'm strongly feeling that our work is not exactly in the domain of speech, it is unhealthy.	[PERSON3] 我强烈地感觉到，我们的工作不完全属于演讲的范畴，是不健康的。
Because there is no concept of speech here.	因为这里没有言语的概念。
We are directly working on text.	我们直接处理文本。
But the thing is that the proposal for a statistical workshop this year is over, which was in September, which was too early for us.	但问题是，今年举办统计研讨会的提议已经结束，那是在 9 月份，对我们来说太早了。
And the next proposal would come for 2022, which would be too late for us.	下一个提案将在 2022 年提出，这对我们来说太晚了。
It is better that if we get either of the two sectile or interspeech, because both of them are well recognized in the community.	这是更好的，如果我们得到两个 sectile 或 interspeech，因为他们都是公认的社区。
We can motivate participants to submit.	我们可以激励参与者提交。
Ah, the only the only caveat that I'm finding now is going with interspeech is like they won't allow us a space in the proceedings, which may deter some of the participants, I am not sure how much they will be excited to publish a paper in archive.	啊，我现在发现的唯一的警告是，interspeech 不会允许我们在会议中有一席之地，这可能会阻止一些参与者，我不知道他们会对在档案馆发表论文有多兴奋。
So, in archives, people can publish any time, right?	所以，在档案馆，人们可以随时出版，对不对？
So that is not a benefit to their profiles.	所以这对他们的档案没有好处。
So how to motivate participants to join our shared task.	因此，如何激励参与者加入我们的共同任务。
So, this was the reason that I especially vouched for the special session.	因此，这就是我特别为特别会议担保的原因。
But this time, the problem is, what I can understand is the last time, the time periods between proposals, submission and final paper submission was five months, so it would have been enough time for our schedule, but this time.	但这一次，问题是，我能理解的是上一次，提案、提交和最终论文提交之间的时间间隔是五个月，所以这对我们的时间表来说是足够的，但这一次。
It is only three months.	只有三个月。
So, I see this fair as an important possible source of non-native English speech that we can use to extend the test set.	所以，我认为这是一个重要的非英语母语语音的可能来源，我们可以用它来扩展测试集。
So, I think we really should focus on the Clearest voice competition, and we can do the booth if we have to.	所以，我认为我们真的应该专注于最清晰的声音比赛，如果有必要，我们可以做展位。
But I would like to limit that, because the dissemination into high school students is less of an impact for us.	但我想限制这一点，因为对高中生的传播对我们的影响较小。
It is more important to use it as a test session.	更重要的是把它作为一个测试会话。
So, we should focus, [PERSON1], on the [PROJECT2] Clearest voice, and keeping the organizers happy so that we can do the data gathering there.	因此，我们应该关注 [PERSON1]，[PROJECT2] 最清晰的声音，让组织者满意，这样我们就可以在那里收集数据。
And do whatever they want us to do in exchange for that, and we need to check their plenary program, and what type of subtitling would be useful for that plenary program.	做他们想让我们做的任何事情作为交换，我们需要检查他们的全体会议节目，以及什么类型的字幕对全体会议节目有用。
so that would make it a test session for us, and as for our own presence at this fair, I don't think it's too important.	所以这对我们来说是一次测试，至于我们自己参加这次展会，我认为这并不太重要。
So, if we are asked, if we are really expected to be there and present, then okay, but if not, then I think it's definitely good for us just to be behind the curtain and behind the scenes and do our job there.	所以，如果有人问我们，是否真的希望我们到场，那好吧，但如果不是，那么我认为这对我们来说肯定是好的，只是在幕后做我们的工作。
(PERSON1) Yeah, I haven't tried to do the registration yet for that, but I think that last time, it was compulsory to have the booth.	[PERSON1] 是的，我还没有尝试过注册，但我想上次，展位是强制性的。
(PERSON2) Yes. So, discuss with them what is needed so that they are happy, and they allow us to do the Clearest voice, which is the most important thing.	[PERSON2] 是的。所以，和他们讨论需要什么才能让他们开心，他们允许我们做最清晰的声音，这才是最重要的。
The test session is less of an urge.	测试会议不那么迫切。
And the booth is just something that we really could avoid, if possible.	如果可能的话，展台是我们可以避免的。
I would have preferred them to join the sessions earlier than doing things like that.	我更希望他们早点参加会议，而不是做这样的事情。
So, we really need to practice these preparations.	所以，我们真的需要练习这些准备工作。
With the online world, it seems that you simply j p into the session, and the work is done.	在网络世界中，似乎你只需简单地进入会话，工作就完成了。
But that is not the case.	但事实并非如此。
It always takes 30 minutes to get it running and properly connected.	它总是需要 30 分钟来运行和正确连接。
So, we need to be there earlier.	所以，我们需要早点到那里。
And if some session that we are doing starts at nine, but the organizers meet at a quarter to nine.	如果我们正在进行的一些会议在九点开始，但组织者在九点差一刻开会。
Then we have to come at a quarter past eight already, so that we have the 30 minutes extra to make sure that everything is running and chase people.	然后我们必须在 8 点 15 分到达，这样我们就有额外的 30 分钟来确保一切都在正常运作，然后赶上他们。
So, this is a remark for everybody that for the management to work, please also anticipate what management might suddenly ask you to do, and that would help a little.	所以，这是给每个人的一句话，为了让管理层工作，也请预测管理层可能突然要求你做什么，这将有所帮助。
Another message that is very important is the recording of these important sessions.	另一个非常重要的信息是这些重要会议的录音。
I don't know if you have responded, I had not seen anyone providing any- any updates to the document.	我不知道你有没有回复，我没有看到任何人对文件做任何更新。
Maybe I forgot to tell all of you.	也许我忘了告诉你们所有人。
I had a document about the experience from [PROJECT4]and [PROJECT5] 2020.	我有一份关于 [PROJECT4] 和 [PROJECT5] 2020 年经历的文件。
And the first point in this experience is that we were very bad at recording these sessions.	这次经历的第一点是，我们非常不擅长记录这些会议。
So, it's important for the purposes of further evaluation or analysis of what went wrong to have good recordings of these sessions.	因此，为了进一步评估或分析问题所在，对这些会议进行良好的记录非常重要。
And one aspect is to get the consents, to actually be allowed to do the recording.	一个方面是获得同意，真正被允许录制。
And even if we try to get the consents in retrospect or whatever.	即使我们试着在事后取得同意。
Then there is the technical aspect of the- of the recording.	然后是录音的技术方面。
And we have seen that this is so diverse and complex.	我们已经看到这是如此多样和复杂。
Yeah, [PERSON5] is sending that link.	是的，[PERSON5] 正在发送该链接。

There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding.	这本书里有很多焦虑，当柯林斯开始原谅格雷迪时，我确实很喜欢看这两个人重新联系，我只是希望格雷迪不要表现得这么爱发牢骚，应该多一点理解。
He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end.	他一直说他理解，但有时他对我有点太咄咄逼人，然后他在结束时很甜蜜。

Doesn't actually do any air "cleaning"	实际上并不做任何空气“净化”
Bought this as a humidifier, the "air cleaning" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something.	买了这个当加湿器，“空气净化”部分其实是虚假广告；取决于你的水有多硬，沉积物确实会堆积在底部，但这些都不是你家里的灰尘，除非你住在煤矿或其他地方。
As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size.	作为一个加湿器，我认为它比同样风扇大小的灯芯型加湿器效果稍差。
The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks.	优点是不消耗灯芯。
Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up.	考虑到这个组件的额外成本，你可能需要运行 5 年来弥补差额。
It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type).	就其尺寸而言，它确实有相当大的水容量，因为“水箱”是该装置的组成部分，而且它的功率很低（尽管不比灯芯型好）。
It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled.	它也很容易清洗，尽管塑料盘不能真正维修，因为盘组件不能拆卸。
However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great.	然而，对于德国工程来说，建造质量并不好。
I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly.	我已经用了一年了，大概有六个月的寒冷天气运行时间，而且这个装置已经从风扇组件发出了非常烦人的咔嗒咔嗒的噪音。
My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here.	我的猜测是风扇轴承，所以我只是等待它完全坏掉。
As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier.	正如其他人所指出的，任何维修几乎等同于购买一个新的吸液芯加湿器。
tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.	tl; dr - 不值得再花钱，你最好用灯芯加湿器。
I guess it was easier to break than they thought.	我想这比他们想的要容易打破。
I am giving this product a 3 star do to the fact when I got it in it was broken already inside.	我给这个产品打了 3 颗星，因为当我拿到它的时候，它已经坏了。
Once I examined it I realized whoever put it in the box put it in there broken, This could have either been the manufacturers packers or for the manufacturers sake the problem could possibly be that a buyer returned the item and claimed they just didn't want it or didn't need it and Amazon possibly did not do a good enough quality check when it came back.	一旦我检查了它，我意识到无论是谁把它放在盒子里，它都是坏的，这可能是制造商包装商或制造商的原因，问题可能是买家退回了物品，并声称他们不想要或不需要它，Amazon 可能没有做足够好的质量检查。
In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence.	平心而论，买家不可能说它坏了，因为那样的话 Amazon 就不会把它拿回来了，这很好，尤其是这种产品，尽管我由于某人的疏忽深感苦恼。
I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance.	不过，我确实拿回了我的钱，所以经过考虑和与我的爱人讨论后，我决定再给这个买家一次机会。
With that said I will only update my rating to a higher star depending on how customer service handles this post (by at least addressing it) and if the item comes in great shape, actually has the opportunity to do what it does, and works well doing what it is supposed to do.	也就是说，我只会根据客户服务如何处理这篇文章（至少通过处理它）来更新我的评级，如果项目状态良好，实际上有机会做它所做的事情，并且做它应该做的事情。
Easy to install?????	易于安装？？？？？
Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install.	总的来说，我对这次购买很满意，但对我来说安装起来并不容易。
I tried installing both "bells" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck.	我试着把两个“铃铛”都安装到插着电源的发射器上，但不幸的是，都无法工作。
I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells.	我准备退货，因为它不工作了，但我想我会再试一次，检查一下铃铛里的电池。
Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working.	瞧...我把电池盖上的小塑料片拉出来，露出来的塑料片盖住了电池，使电池停止工作。
After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase.	在我移除这些塑料片后，铃铛工作正常，我对这次购物非常满意。
The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work.	奇怪的是，在用户说明手册中没有提到电池上的塑料，而要使铃声工作，必须将塑料取下。
It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly.	如果他们提到这一点，事情就不会那么令人沮丧了，我不认为问题在于我没有正确完成安装。
It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want.	这是一个很好的产品，有各种各样的戒指、编钟和曲调供您选择，而且您可以随时轻松更换。
One thing they ask in rating this bell is how "weatherproof" it is.	他们在评价这个铃铛时问的一件事是它的“防风雨”程度。
I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.	我不能对此发表评论，因为它是在 2019 年 7 月 5 日安装的，我们可能要到下一个雨季才能评论它的防风雨性能...大概在 11 月。

After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount.	打了很长时间电话后，他们以 3 美元的折扣向我收取了新订单的费用。
I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher.	我认为这是非常不专业的，因为他们不仅失去了它，而且他们让我相信他们会纠正它，只是在 30 分钟的电话结束时向我收取几乎全价的费用，并谈论一些优惠券。
I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars.	我打了 30 分钟电话，所以我屈服了，又买了一套毛毛虫。

I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable!	我喜欢它的设计和厚实感；它看起来很贵，但是很舒服！
The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time.	我只给了 3 颗星并最终退回产品的唯一原因是因为我意识到我不能一直戴着它。

Might be good on a pole, but NOT as a hanging baffle or weather shield.	在杆子上可能很好，但不是悬挂挡板或挡风板。
Shame on Audubon.	奥杜邦真可耻。
The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and "Make sure it is securely in place."	说明书告诉你将塞子从挡板的孔中向上推，并“确保它牢牢地固定在适当的位置”
HOW???	怎么会？？？
It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind.	它的设计使得挡板只是松散地坐落在塞子上，因此它可以被任何动物或最轻微的风向上推。
You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it.	你可以把塞子倒过来，这样翼形螺钉就在挡板的下面，但是你要花几个小时来转动这些螺钉；没有工具可以做到这一点，只有最小的手指才能轻松完成。
It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug.	我花了一个多小时做了一件半生不熟的工作，把它们拧上，以便把挡板固定在插头上。
It is a complete PITA.	这是一个完整的 PITA 款。
I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards.	我订了四个。我没打开的那三个要直接退货，我在市场上找更好的天气保护装置。

The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out.	信用卡一路下滑，提示不显示，所以你不知道什么卡在哪里，很难拿出来。
THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.	他们展示的卡片伸出位置的照片是不准确的。

I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests.	我喜欢卡拉 ok，所以这款话筒立刻引起了我的兴趣。
I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch.	我认为整体设计不错——玫瑰金的触感很好。
It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone.	这也是一种标准设计，我在有关这种麦克风的所有其他选项上经常可以看到。
For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder.	对于不熟悉的人来说，它的工作方式是同时充当 1）个人麦克风 2）音乐播放器/扬声器和 3）录音机。
Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out.	总之，你有一个 3 合 1 的设备，可以放大你的声音和音乐，并记录所有音频。
There's no music in the mic itself though.	虽然麦克风本身没有音乐。
It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic.	它有一个蓝牙连接器，所以你可以将它同步到你的手机，并下载一个卡拉 ok 应用程序，可以将卡拉 ok 歌曲发送到麦克风。
Or you can even sync your Spotify app.	或者你甚至可以同步你的 Spotify 应用。
Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately.	请注意，不幸的是，麦克风并不适用于每个应用程序。
The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!)	麦克风有不同的选项来调节音乐的音量和你的声音（也分开！）
and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room.	甚至有一个选项来调整回声的水平，让你听起来像是在一个卡拉 ok 房间。
Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic.	我希望看到的未来改进包括：1）不管我把手机放在离话筒多远的地方，都有一些恼人的反馈，似乎不会消失。
If you've figured this out, I'd love to know!	如果你已经想通了，我很想知道！
2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky.	2）麦克风中间的选项开关很笨重。
I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker.	我对极简主义很着迷，所以如果未来的产品能让设计更时尚，那就太好了。
3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting.	3）支持更多的卡拉 ok 应用程序最后，因为声音直接从这个麦克风发出，而不是通过平板电视或中央客厅扬声器系统，所以在聚会环境中没有那么有趣。
If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.	如果制造商能够以某种方式将它集成到一个更大的派对卡拉 ok 生态系统中，那将使这种无限更令人愉快。

The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on.	速度控制真的不可靠 - 如果你拨到 100%，风扇就会关闭，所以你需要把它调到 100%，然后慢慢拨回来，直到重新开始。

The only odd thing I experienced (and I’ve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I’ve tried from different brands) is that mac’s apparently can’t tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA).	我经历的唯一奇怪的事情（我在我尝试过的所有 4 个不同品牌的 usb-c 集线器上都经历过）是，mac 显然无法区分同一显示器的多个显示器（因此我的 mac 向所有通过 HDMI 和/或 VGA 连接到集线器的相同显示器输出相同的视频）。
But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.	但是，如果我使用 2 个独立的集线器/适配器或 2 种不同型号的显示器，那么 mac 可以正确地单独输出到显示器。
Ok, needs some improvement.	好吧，需要改进。

Also if your dog likes to roll around in raccoon poop like mine does it is such a pain in the butt to clean.	另外，如果你的狗像我一样喜欢在浣熊的粪便里打滚，清理起来会很麻烦。
As the fecal matter gets in between the cracks of the device requiring you to disassemble the entire thing to clean it properly and get the smell out.	因为粪便进入装置的缝隙中，需要你拆开整个装置来适当地清洁并去除气味。

We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go.	我们在使用几周后检查了电池，发现水进入了电池所在的隔离层。
The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them.	电池本身已经腐蚀，一种黑色的液体正从电池中流出。
Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well.	从设计上看，电池外壳似乎不可能防水，这意味着不仅洗澡时水进入了电池盒，一些有毒物质也出来了。

It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller.	它有一个更薄的设计形状，更适合手握，没有尖角，电源线是一个永久的附件，它比原来的 XB1 控制器更不容易损坏。
The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker.	缺点是：1）动作游戏中触发的震动效果感觉弱很多。
2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly.	2）控制器的方向操纵杆和按钮磨损非常快。
We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year.	我们的人手非常多，每年会磨损 2-3 个控制器。
So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase.	所以对我们来说，每年在控制器上投资意味着我们必须对我们购买的东西保持精挑细选和谨慎的习惯。
The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.	控制器可以使用更耐用的弹簧；几个月后，最常用的按钮停止响应，右操纵杆失去了它的中心，也就是说，使地图屏幕放大，字符前进，甚至无需触碰控制器。

I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic.	收到这个东西时我很失望，因为脸部周围的银色部分似乎是由某种廉价塑料制成的。

When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that.	当我通过 Virgin Mobile 购买 Stylo 3 时，我只知道一旦我拿到手机并设置好它，一切都会顺利进行，但我在这方面的假设是大错特错。

I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account.	我甚至从来没有能够成功地将这部手机转移到我的 Virgin Mobile 账户。
I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone.	我摆弄这部手机还不到一周。
I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit.	我在互联网上搜索信息，打了各种电话，拼命试图给 Stylo 3 好处，只希望是我做错了，但可悲的是，我浪费了很多时间做这个，因为这个手机的所有问题是我接受不了的。
I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone.	令我失望的是，我不得不给 Stylo 如此糟糕的评价和评论，但我对这款手机非常失望。
Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST.	这是一个巨大的败笔，如果可以的话，希望 LG 升级他们的游戏，并能改进未来的触控笔。
