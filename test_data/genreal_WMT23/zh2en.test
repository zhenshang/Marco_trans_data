g++ 认为预处理后的文件 (.i) 是 c++ 文件 ,并且设定 c++ 形式的连接.	g++ considers the preprocessed record (.i) to be a c++ record, and sets the interface in c++ shape.
源文件后级名指出语言种类以及后期的操作:	The dialect sort and ensuing operations are shown by the post-level title of the source record:
.c C 源程序; 预处理, 编译,汇编	.C source code that does preprocessing, compilation, and gathering

.a 归档库文件(Archive file)	.a File record (Document record)
除非使用了 -cec，-s, 或 -E 选项(或者编译错误阻止了完整的过程),否则连接总是最后的步骤.	Within the nonattendance of the -cec, -s, or -E choices, connecting is continuously the final step (or compilation blunders avoid the total prepare).
在连接阶段中,所有对应于源程序的.e 文件，-1 库文件, 无法识别的文件名(包括指定的.o H 标文件和 .a 库文件)按命令行中的顺序传递给连接器选项 (OPTIONS)	All source program.e records, -1 library records, and obscure record names (counting specified.o H standard records and.a library records) are conveyed to the linker within the association stage within the arrange indicated by the command line alternatives (Choices)
选项必须分立给出 : de ' 完全不同于 `-d -r '.	Parameters must be indicated separately since "de" and "-d -r" are totally diverse.
大多数 ` -=E :和 `-W' 选项有两个相反的格式 : -fname 和 -fno-name (或 -Wname 和 -Wno- name).	The larger part of "-=E:" and "-W" choices have two polar alternate extremes: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
这里只列举不是默认选项的格式.	Here, as it were designs that are not among the standard choices are recorded.

明确指出后面输入文件的语言为 language (而不是从文件名后绥得到的默认选择).	Demonstrate clearly that dialect is the dialect of any extra input records (rather than the default choice from the conclusion of the filename).
这个选项应用于后面所有的输入文件, 直到遇着下一个 `-x' 选项 .language 的可选	This alternative is appropriate to all input records after that up until the following "-x" choice. dialect not required

了的目标文件.	The target record.
编译后即停止, 不进行汇编件.	Stops after compilation and does not perform get together.
在编译过程的不同阶段间使用管道而非临时文件进行工作, 因为那些系统的汇编器不能从管道读取数据，GNU 的汇编器没有这个问题，汇编器能够接受的 C "方言 ": 支持符合 ANSI 标准的 C 程序.	Since the constructing agents on those frameworks cannot examined from channels, utilize channels instead of brief records to move between the different compilation stages, this issue does not exist within the GNU constructing agent, constructing agents can utilize C "lingos" that bolster ANSI-compliant standard C programs.
这样就会关闭 GNU Cc 中某些不兼容 ANSI Cc 的特性关键字, 以及诸如 unix 和 vax 这些表明当迎和极少使用的 ANSI trigraph 特性,以及禁上尽管使 用了(译注 :宿主环境 (hosted environment) 下所有的标准库可用，main 函数返回 一个 int 值, 典型例子是除了内核以外几乎所有的程序.对应的独立环境 (f£reestanding environment) 不存在标准库, 程序入口也不一定是 main, 最明显的例子就是操作系统内核.详情参考 gcc 网站最近的资料)	This would impair ANSI trigraph highlights like unix and vax, which are stamped as welcome but occasionally utilized, as well as those that are utilized indeed in case they are not welcome and a few include watchwords in GNU Cc that are contradictory with ANSI Cc, all standard libraries have get to to (Explanation: Facilitated environment (facilitated environment)), and the most work returns an int esteem, the endless larger part of programs, barring the part, serve as an illustration, there's no standard library within the related free environment (unsupported environment), and the program section require not always be fundamental.

对于没有参数的函数声明, 例如 `int foo ();', 按 C 风格处理 --- 即不说明参数个数或类型. (仅针对 C++) .	Treat work statements that do not have parameters, like "int foo ();," within the C way, which implies you shouldn't indicate the number or kind of parameters. (C++ as it were) .
正常情况下, 这样的函数 foo 在 C++ 中意味着参数为空.	In C++, a function like foo often indicates that the argument is empty.
节清单从这里删到试图支持传统 C 编译器的某些方面.	Here, segment postings have been trimmed in an exertion to suit a few highlights of customary C compilers.
详见NU c 手册,我们已经把细节删除, 这样当内容过时后, 人们也不会 HERI.	Subtle elements can be found within the NU c handbook; we evacuated them so that perusers wouldn't HERI when the data was not pertinent.
除了一件事: 对于 c++ 程序 (不是C)，` -traditional' 选项带来一个附加效应,允许对 this 赋值.	With one exception: the “-traditional” option has the unintended side effect of enabling assignment to this for C++ applications (but not C).
他和`-Ethis-is-variable' 选项的果一样.	It has the same impact as the "-Ethis-is-variable" alternative.
-traditional-cpp 试图支持传统 Cc 预处理器的某些方面.	-traditional-cpp bolsters a number of highlights of the customary Cc preprocessor.
特别是上面提到有关预处理器的内容, 但是不包括 `-traditional' 选项的其他效应.	Especially, the preprocessor demonstrated over, but not the other results of the "-conventional" alternative.
-fdollars-in-identifiers 允许在标识符 (identifier) 中使用 `$' 字符 (仅针对 C++) .	-fdollars-in-identifiers “$” characters are allowed in identifiers (as it were in C++).
你可以指定 `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' 选项显明禁止使用 `$' 符.	The "-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers" alternative can be utilized to particularly cripple the "$" character.
(GNU C++ 在某些目标系统缺省允许 `$' 符, 但不是所有系统.)	(On a few target frameworks, GNU C++ licenses the “$” character by default, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv 允许 ant 类型到枚举类型 (enumeration) 的隐式转换 (MEF c++) .	-fenum-int-equiv (MEF C++) Allow verifiable change of subterranean insect sorts to identification sorts.
正常情况下 GNU C++ 允许从 enum 到 int 的转换,反之则不行.	Enum to int change is ordinarily allowed in GNU C++, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-—templates 为模板声明 (template declaration) 产生较小的代码 (仅限于 c++)，方法是对于每个模板函数 (template function),只在 定义他们的地方生成一个副本.	-fexternal—templates Decrease the estimate of format affirmations (as it were in C++) by replicating each layout work as it were where it is characterized.
想要成功使用这个选项, 你必须在所有使用模板的文件中,标记`#pragma implementatio'(定义)或 `#Pragma interface'(声明).	For this choice to work, all template-using records must be checked with "#pragma implementatio" (definition) or "#Pragma interface" (announcement).
程序用 `-fexternal-templates ' 编译时, 模板实例 (template instantiation) 全部是外部类型.你必须让需要的实例在实现文件中出现.	Format instantiations are all outside sorts when a program is compiled with the alternative "-fexternal-templates". The execution file's essential occurrences must be made to seem.
可以通过 typedef 实现这一点, 他引用所需的每个实例.	With typedefs, which make reference to each required occasion, this is often conceivable.
相对应的, 如果编译时使用缺省选项 ` -fno-exteznal-templates', 所有模板实例明确的设为内置.	Hence, all format occasions are expressly indicated as built-ins when compiling with the default "-fno-exteznal-templates" choice.
所有的成员函数(除了构造子函数和 mnew 或 delete 成员操作符) 视为所在类的虚函数.	All part capacities are dealt with as virtual capacities of the encasing lesson, with the exemption of constructor capacities and the mnew and erase part administrators.
这不表明每次调用成员函数都将通过内部虚函数表.	Not each call to a part work will essentially go through the inside vtable as a result of this.
有些情况下, 编译器能够判断出可以直接调用某个虚函数; 这时就直接调用.	A virtual work may once in a while be able to be called specifically in case the compiler decides it can; in this case, it'll be.
-fcond-mismatch 允许条件表达式的第二和第三个参数的类型不匹配.	-fcond-mismatch Acknowledge a sort jumble between the condition expression's moment and third contentions.
这种表达式的值是 Void.-fthis-—is-variable 允许对 this 赋值 (仅对 c++).	Such an expression incorporates a esteem of Void. Task to typically permitted (as it were in C++) utilizing the hail -fthis—is-variable.
合并用户自定义的自由存储管理机制到 c++ 后,使可赋值的`this' 显得不合时宜.	Assignable "this" got to be out of date when user-defined free capacity administration was included to C++.
因此, 默认情况下, 类成员函数内部对 this 赋值是无效操作.	Task to this interior a course part work is in this way by default a lawful operation.
然而为了向后兼容, 你可以通过 `-fthis-is-variable' 选项使这种操作有效.	With the “-fthis-is-variable” choice, you'll permit this in spite of the fact that for in reverse compatibility.
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型,如同 unsigned char.	-funsigned-char Characterize char as a sort that's unsigned, comparable to unsigned char.
各种机器都有自己缺省的 char 类型. 既可能是 unsigned char 也可能是 signed char.	Each machine features a one of a kind default char sort. It may well be either marked or unsigned char.
理想情况下, 当依赖于数据的符号性时, 一个可移植程序总是应该使用 signed char 或 unsigned chaz.	When depending on the signedness of the information, a convenient program ought to continuously utilize marked char or unsigned chaz.
但是许多程序已经写成只用简单的 char, 并且期街这是有符号数(或者无符号数, 具体情况取决于编写程序的目标机器).	However, a part of apps as it were back plain char and anticipate this to be marked (or unsigned, depending on the machine the program is composed for).
这个选项, 和它的反义选项, 使那样的程序工作在对应的默认值上.	This choice and its inverse constrain the identical default behavior for that program.
char 的类型始终应该明确定义为 signed char 或 unsigned char, 即使它表现的和其中之一完全一样.	Indeed in spite of the fact that a char carries on absolutely like one of them, its sort ought to continuously be explicitly expressed as either a marked char or an unsigned char.
如果没有明确声明 ` signed' 或 "unsigned'修饰符, 这些选项用来定义有符号位域 (bitfield) 或无符号位域.	These alternatives are utilized to characterize marked or unsigned bitfields in case no “signed” or “unsigned” modifiers are explicitly given.
缺省情况下,位域是有符号的, 因为他们继承的基本整数类型,如 int,是有符号数，然而, 如果指定了 `-traditional' 选项,位域永远是无符号数.	In spite of the fact that the basic numbers sorts they infer from, like int, are marked, bitfields are marked by default; be that as it may, in the event that the “-traditional” alternative is provided, bitfields are continuously unsigned.
-fwritable-strings把字符串常量存储到可写数据段, 而且不做特别对待.	String constants are not given uncommon treatment by -fwritable-strings; instep, they are put away within the writable information fragment.
这是为了兼容一些老程序,他们算改字符串常量是一个非常糟糕的想法、`-traditional' 选项也有相同效果.	Typically done to guarantee compatibility with more seasoned applications that do not think it's a great thought to alter string constants, the same result is accomplished utilizing the “-traditional” choice.
执行摘要	Official blend
新冠肺炎对毒品市场的影响	COVID-19's impacts on the pharmaceutical showcase
其影响可能类似于2008年的经济危机	The impacts can be comparable to the monetary emergency of 2008
全球性的新冠肺炎疫情已使全世界陷入前所未有的危机。	The globe is right now encountering an unparalleled emergency as a result of the COVID-19 scourge.
在许多国家，这一疾病己使医疗服务机构穷于应付，几近崩溃，各国政府实施的限制措施已在全球经济中造成了严重紊乱。	The affliction has disabled wellbeing frameworks in a few countries to the point of collapse, and government confinements have seriously disturbed the world economy.
对于毒品市场，这场疫情的影响尚不清楚，也很难预测，但有可能影响深远。	The outbreak's impacts on the pharma industry are vague and difficult to estimate, but they may be critical.
一些生产者可能会被迫寻找新的方法来制造毒品，因为限制流动的同时也限制了前体和基本化学品的获取。	Due to the constrained get to to antecedents and essential chemicals caused by development confinements, certain makers may be obliged to create modern strategies of medicine generation.
贩运者由于旅行限制而无法越境，可能不得不寻找新的路线和方法。	Due to travel limitations, traffickers may got to discover elective courses and methods to cross nations.
毒品使用和提供的模式可能会改变，政府的应对能力也可能会受到阻碍。	Governments' capacity to respond may be blocked on the off chance that sedate utilize and accessibility designs move.
新冠肺炎带来的转变是前所未有的，但还是可以从以往的危机中吸取一些经验教训。	In spite of the fact that the COVID-19 move is bizarre, there are a few lessons to be learned from other emergencies.
2008年经济危机后，一些吸毒者开始寻找更便宜的合成物质，使用模式转向注射毒品。	A few sedate clients begun searching for less costly manufactured drugs amid the 2008 budgetary emergency, and their drug-using propensities changed to sedate infusion.
与此同时，各国政府削减了与毒品相关的预算。	Governments have moreover diminished financing for drug-related programs.
如果各国政府以同样的方式应对当前的经济衰退，预防吸毒和相关风险行为等干预措施和戒毒治疗服务可能会受到沉重打击。	Intercessions like medicate utilize and related hazard behavior anticipation and medicate treatment programs may be extremely hurt in the event that governments reacted to the show retreat within the same way.
此外，拦截行动和国际合作的优先性可能会降低，使贩运者更容易行动。	Additionally, interdiction endeavors and universal collaboration may get less consideration, which would make it easier for traffickers to conduct their commerce.
一些国家有大量毒品通过商业航班走私，预计这些国家的贩毒活动受到的直接影响最大。	Nations where noteworthy sums of opiates are snuck on commercial flights are expected to be most extremely affected.
有信使将甲基苯丙胺等合成毒品放在随身背包或藏在私人行李中携带，有时数量很大。由于几乎各地都对航空客运实施了限制，利用商业航空旅行供应毒品的活动可能会完全中断。	Some of the time in colossal amounts, dispatches transport engineered drugs like methamphetamine in masked carry-on packs or rucksacks. Since that limits on discuss traveler activity are being actualized essentially all over, the utilize of commercial flying for the transportation of drugs can be totally hampered.
尽管国际邮政供应链也受到了干扰，但利用暗网和货物邮寄进行贩运的活动可能会增加。	Regardless the disturbance of worldwide postal supply lines, there may be an upsurge within the trafficking of things by means of the mail and the dull web.
从长远来看，经济衰退和相关的封闭措施可能会打乱毒品市场。	The long-term impacts of the retreat and related lockdowns may cause the pharmaceutical industry to be disturbed.
由于不断上升的失业率和缺乏机会，贫困和弱势人群将更有可能以有害的方式吸毒，患上吸毒病症，并转向与毒品有关的非法活动一无论是生产还是运输。	The destitute and powerless will be more slanted to utilize drugs hurtfully, create sedate utilize disarranges, and lock in in unlawful drug-related activities—whether generation or transportation—as a result of expanded unemployment and a need of openings.
贩毒组织可能会利用这种情况，向脆弱人群提供服务，并招募新成员来壮大队伍。	Sedate trafficking organizations might benefit from this circumstance by making a difference out distraught bunches and enrolling unused individuals to swell their numbers.
随着政府应对能力的降低，这些转变可能会快速扎根，成为许多社区的新现实。	These changes might effectively build up themselves as the modern typical in numerous places on the off chance that the government's capacity to reply is restricted.
扩张与复杂性	Development and Complexity
市场增长	Advertise development
人口增长模式部分解释了市场扩张的原因	Showcase development is to some degree clarified by populace development designs
世界各地的吸毒现象一直在增多，无论是从总体数字还是从吸毒者在世界人口中所占比例来看都是如此。	Both the outright number of individuals utilizing drugs and the rate of the worldwide populace utilizing drugs have been rising.
2009年估计吸毒者有2.1亿人，占全球15-64岁人口的4.8%,而2018年估计吸毒者有2.69亿人，占这类人口的5.3%。	In 2018, there were an estimated 0.269 billion drug users, which is 5.3% more than there were in 2009, when there were an estimated 0.210 billion users, or 4.8% of the world's population of people aged 15 to 64.
在过去二十年期间，发展中国家吸毒情况的增长速度远远快于发达国家。	Sedate utilization has expanded altogether more rapidly in developing countries than in industrialized countries over the past 20 a long time.
这在一定程度上反映了这一期间总体人口增长的差异、发达国家为7%,发展中国家为28%但也反映了发展中国家年 轻人口增长较快。	This to some degree reflects the reality that worldwide populace development amid the time shifted between industrialized and creating nations, at 7% and 28%, separately, but it moreover reflects the more youthful populaces in poorer nations developing more rapidly.
青少年和年轻成年人在吸毒者中所占比例最大。	Youthful individuals and young people account for the larger part of sedate clients.
在2000-2018年期间，发展中国家这一年龄段的人口增长了16%,而发达国家这一年龄段的人口减少了10%。	The populace of this age bunch expanded by 16% within the creating world between 2000 and 2018, whereas it shrank by 10% within the created world.
1城市化是当前和未来毒品市场的一个驱动因素	One figure driving both the show and future pharmaceutical markets is urbanization
无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，城市地区的吸毒情况都多于农村地区。	Urban zones are more likely than country ones to have a sedate issue, both in created and creating countries.
吸毒情况总体增多的部分原因是人口从农村向城镇的大规模流动一目前全世界人口有一半以上生活在城市地区，而1960年这一比例为34%。	More than half of the world's populace presently lives in urban locales, up from 34% in 1960, and this colossal relocation from rustic to urban regions is to a great extent to fault for the common rise in sedate utilize.
城市化可能是毒品市场未来动态的一个关键因素，特别是在城市化趋势更为突出的发展中国家。	Urbanization may play a critical part within the dynamics of sedate markets within the future, especially in developing countries where urbanization is more articulated.
财富的增加与吸毒情况增多相联，但承受疾病负担最大的是最贫穷的人在世界范围内，发达国家的吸毒情况比发展中国家更为普遍。	Expanded riches is connected to an increment in medicate utilize, but the poorest individuals are most influenced by infection, medicate utilization is more common in created countries than in creating countries in general.
可卡因之类的毒品更是与世界上较富裕的地区联系较为牢固。	Substances like cocaine are more closely connected to more princely districts of the world.
同样，在各国内部，社会富裕阶层的吸毒流行率较高。	Comparable to how it is among countries, medicate utilize is more common among the more rich areas of society.
但转为吸毒病症的比率较高的却是社会经济地位较低的人。	However, individuals with lower financial position move to substance utilize issues at higher rates.
来自少数几个国家的数据表明，有害的吸毒模式与病症同低收入之间存在联系。	Moo pay and unsafe medicate utilize designs and conditions are related, agreeing to information from a little number of countries.
这些模式在较富裕的社会阶层似乎不太常见。	These patterns appear to be less predominant among financial classes with more prominent riches.
全球新冠肺炎危机造成的经济制约很可能会加剧包括吸毒者在内的最弱势群体的风险。	The risks for the foremost powerless people, such as medicate clients, are anticipated to be made more awful by the financial confinements forced by the around the world COVID-19 emergency.
例如，劳动力市场的变化，如失业率上升，过去一直与吸毒情况的增加有关，而这场疫情己经迫使全球数千万人失业。	For occasion, the scourge has tossed tens of millions of individuals out of work universally and changes within the labor advertise, such as rising unemployment, have already been related to expanded sedate utilize.
新冠肺炎或将导致毒品市场进一步扩张新冠肺炎的大流行可能会导致更多农民增加或从事非法作物种植，或是因为国家主管机关的控制能力降低，或是因为在经济危机之下可能有更多人不得不铤而走险，从事非法活动。	The pharma showcase seem develop encourage as a result of COVID-19, got to take chances and do illegal things.
新冠肺炎的相关限制措施导致空中和陆路交通减少，海上贩运可能已经因此而增加，海上的拦截风险低，而且比空中或陆路走私的数量更多。	Due to COVID-19-related imperatives, there may have been an upsurge in trafficking by ocean since it is less likely to be catching and can carry greater volumes of booty than arrive or discuss.
最近已有报告称可卡因货物直接从南美经由海路运往欧洲。	There have recently been rumors of cocaine shipments traveling directly by sea from South America to Europe.
复杂性增强	Expanded complexity
非国际管制物质的出现情况稳定，但有潜在危害的新型类阿片正在增多毒品市场正日趋复杂。	Whereas the sum of chemicals not subject to worldwide control is unfaltering, the presentation of unused, possibly perilous opioids is on the rise, the pharmaceutical industry is getting trickier to explore.
除大麻、可卡因和海洛因等植物类物质之外，已经增添了数百种合成毒品，其中许多并不在国际管制之下。药品的非医疗使用也快速增多。	Numerous engineered drugs, numerous of which are not controlled universally, have been included to plant-based opiates like pot, cocaine, and heroin. Medicate utilization for purposes other than treating ailment is additionally rising rapidly.
会员国的国内市场每年约有500种新型活性物质。	On the residential showcase of Part States, around 500 modern dynamic chemicals are presented each year.
目前其中大多是兴奋剂，其次是合成的大麻素受体激动剂和少量的类阿片。	These days, stimulants make up the larger part of these, taken after by manufactured cannabinoid receptor agonists and a little number of opioids.
虽然新型精神活性物质的总体数量已经稳定下来，但比例发生了变化。	NPS numbers have stabilized for the most part, but the proportions have moved.
在2014年确定的新型精神活性物质种类总数中，类阿片新型精神活性物质仅占2%,但到2018年，这一数字己上升至9%。	In 2014, opioid NPS made up fair 2% of all NPS found; by 2018, this extent had expanded to 9%.
类阿片新型精神活性物质中有许多是芬太尼的类似物，其药效和危害已得到证明，在北美导致了过量死亡事件，其他区域也有，但程度较轻。	Overdose passing  from NPS opioids, numerous of which are fentanyl analogs, have been reported in North America and, to a lesser degree, abroad.
在北美，芬太尼有的用作海洛因和其他毒品（包括可卡因和甲基苯丙胺）的掺杂剂，有的用来制造假冒的药用类阿片。	Fentanyl is utilized in North America to create fake pharmaceutical painkillers or as a doping specialist for heroin and other substances like cocaine and methamphetamine.
一些证据表明，欧洲也有注射新型精神活性物质兴奋剂的现象：一项对欧洲六个城市废弃注射器残留物的研宄发现，许多注射器都沾有产生兴奋作用的新型精神活性物质》	There's a few sign that NPS stimulants are infused in Europe as well: Much of the remains from utilized syringes are recolored with NPS, which can deliver stimulants, agreeing to a ponder done on them in six European cities
2新型精神活性物质的使用可能会逐渐牢固存在于弱势群体中	2 Modern psychoactive sedate utilize seem ended up broadly acknowledged in vulnerable communities
单一种类的新型精神活性物质几乎从未形成大的市场。	Seldom does a single lesson of NPS make a sizable advertise.
但来自欧洲的证据表明，合成大麻素在无家可归者和监狱囚犯等社会边缘群体中是一个严重的问题。	In any case, information from Europe shows that manufactured cannabinoids are a critical issue for socially prohibited bunches counting the destitute and detainees.
有22个国家报告了监狱中使用新型精神活性物质的情况，其中大多数国家将合成大麻素确定为主要挑战。	22 countries detailed on the utilization of NPS in detainment facilities, and the lion's share of them cited manufactured cannabinoids as a noteworthy impediment.
对前体化学品的管制迫使制毒者进行创新最常作为前体用来合成苯丙胺、甲基苯丙胺和“摇头丸”等毒品的许多化学品已被置于国际管制之下。	Forerunner chemical control compels drug makers to enhance, numerous substances that are as often as possible utilized as building squares for opiates counting amphetamine, methamphetamine, and "happiness" have been set beneath universal control.
贩毒者和制毒者一直在寻找替代品一不仅有管制较松的物质，还有专门为规避管制而设计的化学品，即所谓的“特制前体”。	Medicate makers and traffickers are continually investigating for substitutes, counting not as it were less entirely controlled drugs but moreover substances made intentioned to urge over existing directions, or "architect antecedents."
旨在阻止新冠肺炎传播的限制性措施很可能使依赖前体化学品的制毒者受到进一步挤压。	Medicate producers who depend on antecedent chemicals would certainly feel the impacts of prohibitive measures planning to halt the spread of COVID-19.
来自墨西哥的证据表明，这已经成为 现实：据报告，2020年3月，从东亚进口的甲基苯丙胺前体短缺促使墨西哥和美国的甲基苯丙胺价格上涨。	Information from Mexico infers that this is often as of now the case: in Walk 2020, Mexico and the Joined together States detailed cost rises for methamphetamine due to deficiencies of forerunners provided from East Asia.
市场瞬息万变	The showcase is changing quickly
合成药物在中亚和俄罗斯联邦取代阿片剂	In Central Asia and the Russian Alliance, manufactured substances are taking the put of sedatives
中亚和俄罗斯联邦的阿片剂市场在2008年至2018年期间似乎发生了变化。	From 2008 and 2018, it shows up that the sedative markets in Central Asia and the Russian League have moved.
俄罗斯联邦当局截获的阿片剂数量下降了约80%，同时因使用类阿片而接受治疗的人数大幅减少。	Whereas less individuals are getting treatment for opioid utilization, the number of sedatives reallocated by Russian League specialists has diminished by generally 80%.
但兴奋剂市场却似乎日渐兴旺。	However it appears just like the doping industry is doing well.
有证据表明，甲基苯丙胺和各种卡西酮，包括甲氧麻黄酮和 a - 吡咯烷基苯戊酮，现在俄罗斯毒品市场上随处可见。	There's confirmation that the Russian medicate advertise is right now overflowed with methamphetamine and a few cathinones, such as mephedrone and a-pyrrolidinylvalerone.
俄罗斯当局报告称，最近查获的制造各种非法药物的秘密加工点数量急剧上升，在两年内翻了一番多，2018年增至152个加工点。	More than multiplying in estimate over the course of two a long time, to 152 research facilities in 2018, Russian police detailed a considerable increment in later seizures of incognito research facilities creating a assortment of illegal opiates.
阿富汗和伊拉克甲基苯丙胺市场增长	Showcase development for methamphetamine in Afghanistan and Iraq
早在2012年，对医院、监狱和其他机构人员的调查就已经揭示了甲基苯丙胺在伊拉克的重要性。	Examinations of staff individuals in clinics, correctional facilities, and other teach as early as 2012 had demonstrated the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
结晶甲基苯丙胺已经成为“芬乃他林”和曲马多之外又一种令人担忧的主要药物。	Along with "captagon" and tramadol, crystalline methamphetamine has developed as one of the foremost concerning drugs.
2015年的一项研宄进一步证实了这些发现，吸毒者表示大麻比“芬乃他林”或甲基苯丙胺更难获得。	Medicate clients said that cannabis was more troublesome to get than "captagon" or methamphetamine in a 2015 ponder, which backed these discoveries.
最近，伊拉克当局发现了多个甲基苯丙胺加工点，麻管局已对伪麻黄碱制剂的大批进口表示关切一甲基苯丙胺加工点将这些制剂用作前体。	The Board has voiced stress with respect to the importation of critical sums of pseudoephedrine arrangements, which are utilized as antecedents by methamphetamine research facilities, in light of the later disclosure of methamphetamine research facilities by Iraqi specialists.
在阿富汗，甲基苯丙胺制造似乎始于2014年。	The generation of methamphetamine in Afghanistan accepted to have begun around 2014.
自那时起，甲基苯丙胺的缉获量一直在稳步上升。	Since at that point, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily expanding.
但2019年上半年的缉获量一^657公斤——与上一年相比大幅骤增。	But compared to the earlier year, seizures within the to begin with half of 2019 come to 657kg, a noteworthy increment.
在其他国家大量缉获了据认为源自阿富汗的甲基苯丙胺，这也表明该国的产量正在迅速上升。	Considerable methamphetamine seizures in other countries that are assumed to have come from Afghanistan moreover suggest that make in that country is expanding rapidly.
政策变化和变化趋势	Patterns and Changes in Arrangement
非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域大多有大麻使用增多的趋势	Cannabis utilization contains a inclination to rise in purviews where it is authorized for recreational utilize
加拿大、乌拉圭和美国的11个法域允许制造大麻产品供非医疗使用。	The generation of cannabis items for non-medical utilize is legitimate in eleven wards over Canada, Uruguay, and the Joined together States.
在其中多数法域，大麻使用自合法化以来有所增多，尽管在其他未将非医疗使用大麻合法化的法域也观察到了同样的趋势。	The larger part of these locales have seen a rise in cannabis utilize since legalization, be that as it may, other purviews without such enactment have moreover seen this design.
在美国最早通过立法的两个州科罗拉多州和华盛顿州，成年人非医疗使用大麻的情况增加，特别是过去一个月以及每天或几乎每天使用的情况增多，自2012年起便已超过了全国平均水平。	Grown-up non-medical pot utilize has surged, particularly within the past month, and day by day or nearly every day utilize has surpassed the national normal since 2012 in Colorado and Washington, two of the primary US states to endorse laws.
所有指标都显示，自2011年以来，乌拉圭的大麻使用情况有所增加，上月使用情况几乎翻了一番。	Numerous signs point to an upsurge in cannabis utilize in Uruguay since 2011, with utilization about multiplying within the past month.
这表明增加的主要原因是经常和频繁使用大麻。	This appears that visit and standard cannabis utilize is the essential cause of the rise.
加拿大的短期数据也表明，2018年至2019年合法市场扩大的同时，使用量也在增加。	Short-term information from Canada moreover demonstrate that a rise in utilization coincided with the legitimate market's development from 2018 to 2019.
然而，2019年仍有40%的大麻使用者靠非法来源获得某些产品。	40% of cannabis customers in 2019 in any case proceeded to buy certain merchandise from unlawful sources.
全球大麻药草缉获量暴跌的背后原因是大麻合法化？	Is the sharp decrease in worldwide seizures of pot herb due to cannabis legalization?
2018年，全球大麻药草缉获量降至20年来的最低水平，这是因为北美的缉获量下降，在过去10年中下降了 84%。	Seizures of cannabis herb plunged to their least level universally in 2018 and had diminished by 84% over the past 10 a long time in North America.
相比之下，同期世界其他地区的缉获量几乎翻了一番。缉获的模式表明，旨在放开大麻市场的政策在下降中发挥了关键作用。	Seizures, in the mean time, about multiplied in other parts of the world over the same time span. Concurring to the seizure slant, directions pointing at liberalizing the pot showcase were a major figure within the drop.
对新型精神活性物质的监管似乎有遏制作用在国内对新型精神活性物质的监管效果仍然很难评估。	NPS control shows up to have a dissuasive impact, it is still challenging to assess the household control of NPS.
一些对新型精神活性物质采用不同监管制度的国家显示出不同的新型精神活性物质使用流行率。	The predominance of NPS utilize changes among a few countries with particular NPS administrative systems.
在另一些国家，通过国内立法后，新型精神活性物质使用情况有所减少。	With the sanctioning of household enactment, the utilize of NPS has diminished in different countries.
弱势群体面临合法和非法毒品市场的伤害用于疼痛管理和姑息治疗的药用类阿片主要在高收入国家提供止痛药在各区域分布不均。	Both the legitimate and unlawful sedate markets harmed defenseless bunches, pharmaceutical opioids are for the most part accessible in high-income countries for the treatment of torment and palliative care, territorial incongruities exist within the conveyance of torment mitigation.
2018年，所有可供医疗消费的药用类阿片中，90%以上在高收入国家。	In 2018, high-income countries accounted for more than 90% of all medicine opioids that were accessible for therapeutic utilize.
大约50%在北美，40%在欧洲，还有2%在大洋洲。	There are 2% in Oceania, 50% in North America, and 40% in Europe.
这些国家的人口约占全球人口的12%。	The populace of these countries makes up around 12% of the complete world.
据估计，低收入和中等收入国家的人口占全球人口的88%,但消费的药用类阿片却不到10%。	In spite of the fact that moo- and middle-income countries are thought to be domestic to 88% of the world's populace, they as it were utilize 10% of all pharmaceutical opioids.
获取药用类阿片的障碍与许多因素有关，包括立法、文化、卫生系统和处方做法。	Enactment, culture, healthcare frameworks, and endorsing hones are some of the numerous components that might make obstructions to getting to pharmaceutical opioids.
较贫穷的人患吸毒病症的风险更大2018年约有3,560万人患有吸毒病症。	A substance utilize clutter is more likely to develop in those who are less well off, In 2018, 35,600 thousand individuals were influenced by a substance utilize issue.
贫困、有限的教育和社会边缘化可能会增加吸毒病症风险，并加剧其后果。高收入国家的研宄证实了这一点，在这些研究中，个人不利的社会经济轨迹一不仅仅是他们在某一时间点的状况一也与吸毒病症风险有关。	Destitution, a need of instruction, and social prohibition may make substance utilize disarranges more likely to happen and decline their impacts. Thinks about in high-income countries have appeared that the likelihood of creating a sedate utilize clutter is additionally related with people's antagonistic financial directions, not as it were their status at a specific point in time.
吸毒病症还会加深社会经济劣势，进一步增加失业、贫困和无家可归的风险，从而助长劣势的恶性循环。这些结果也可能与刑事司法系统内的侮辱性态度和后果有关。	In expansion to compounding financial drawback, sedate utilize clutters can too increment the chance of unemployment, destitution, and vagrancy, making a horrendous cycle of drawback. These discoveries might moreover be associated to the criminal equity system's stigmatizing hones and results.
妇女、少数民族和移民、性取向多样化群体、因武装冲突或灾难而流离失所的人以及农村环境中的人也可能受到吸毒病症的过重影响，或者在获得治疗服务方面遇到问题。	Individuals in rustic zones, ladies, individuals of sexually assorted bunches, migrants, and individuals of ethnic minorities may too be excessively influenced by substance utilize clutters or have trouble getting to treatment offices.
根据估计因残疾和过早死亡而损失的健康寿命年数的残疾调整寿命年（DALY)指标，在过去10年中，有害的吸毒对范围更广的社会影响加重。	The disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) marker, which calculates the a long time of sound life misplaced to incapacity and untimely passing, demonstrates that the affect of destructive sedate utilize on society as a entirety has gotten more regrettable over the past ten a long time.
2007年至2018年间，归因于吸毒的全球残疾调整寿命年数增加了 17%。	Between 2007 and 2018, the number of worldwide disability-adjusted life a long time credited to medicate utilization rose by 17%.
注射吸毒者中常见的未经治疗的丙型肝炎导致的肝癌的相关残疾调整寿命年数增幅特别高——达到40%。	Untreated hepatitis C, which is predominant among infusing medicate clients, essentially expanded the number of DALYs (disease-associated mortality occasions) connected to liver cancer (up to 40%).
毒品和暴力之间的关系错综复杂很难确定精神活性物质的使用和暴力之间的所有因果关系。	It is challenging to set up all causal joins between the utilize of psychoactive substances and savagery since the relationship between drugs and savagery is complex.
全球范围的有限数据表明，迷醉可能是杀人的一个重要因素。	Inebriation may play a critical part in crime, agreeing to constrained information from around the world.
但在暴力事件中，酒精的作用似乎比毒品更大。	In any case, it appears that drinking contributes more to savage occasions than do drugs.
虽然吸毒可能会导致犯罪，但在某些情况下，这种联系可以部分归因于多种中介因素，如社会经济劣势以及由个人风险、家庭环境和同龄人影响造成的其他类型的逆境。	Sedate utilize may contribute to wrongdoing, but this interface may moreover be mostly clarified by a number of intervening variables, counting financial hardship and other sorts of difficulty brought on by individual hazard, family flow, and peer weight.
贩毒和暴力之间的联系是多方面的。	Viciousness and medicate trafficking are closely related on numerous levels.
如果已有稳定的犯罪结构，包括国际贩毒在内的大规模有组织犯罪活动有可能在无暴力的情况下实施。	On the off chance that steady criminal organizations are in put, large-scale organized wrongdoing, counting universal medicate trafficking, is likely to be carried out without viciousness.
短期内，暴力的存在和程度与其说取决于贩运的数量，不如说取决于造成有组织犯罪集团之间力量平衡不稳定的某些变化，例如非法市场规模的变化，知名罪犯的死亡或监禁，以及使一个集团弱于另一个集团的执法措施。	Within the brief term, the nearness and concentrated of viciousness are less subordinate on the sum of trafficking than they are on certain changes that disturbed the pecking order of organized crime, such as shifts within the estimate of the dark showcase, high-profile criminals' downfall or imprisonment, and authorization activities that make one gather more helpless than another.
最新趋势	Most recent patterns
吸毒大麻是最常用的物质，类阿片危害最大	Opioids = most dangerous, marijuana = most used
据估计，2018年使用大麻的有 1.92 亿人，使之成为全球使用最多的毒品。	Cannabis was the top substance used globally in 2018 by 0.192 billion people.
相比之下，2018年使用类阿片的有5,800万人。	58 million people used opioids in 2018, in contrast.
但阿片类药物的相关危害却因使用者较少而受到忽视。	Few opioid users, unnoticed risks.
在2017年与吸毒病症有关的估计167,000例死亡中，有66%是这类物质造成的，在据信为吸毒导致的残疾或过早死亡而损失的2,100万年寿命中，有50%是这类物质造成的。	50 percent of the 21 million years of life thought to have been lost to drug-related disability or premature death in 2017 and 66 percent of the projected 167,000 deaths from drug use disorders were attributed to substances, Resulting from chemicals.
合成类阿片的非医疗使用加剧了公共卫生危机	Synthetic opioid abuse worsens public health crisis
在西非、中部非洲和北非，加剧类阿片危机的是曲马多；在北美则是芬太尼。这两个区域在经济、人口统计数据或一般吸毒模式方面几乎没有共同点，但都在奋力抗击由容易获得且生产成本低的物质助长的类阿片危机。	In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is fueling the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The opioid problem is being exacerbated by easily accessible and inexpensively produced drugs in the two locations, which have little in common in terms of economics, demographics, or overall drug usage trends.
在北美，芬太尼等合成类阿片的使用导致了20年来类阿片过量致死人数增加。	A rise in opioid overdose mortality of 20 years has been attributed to the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl in North America.
2018年，在美国登记的67,367例过量死亡中，有三分之二涉及芬太尼。	Fentanyl was involved in two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States in 2018.
加拿大也报告了类似的结果，只是数字较低。	Canada reported similar results in smaller numbers.
芬太尼导致过量死亡的部分原因是非法药物市场上的芬太尼药效不可预测。	The variable potency of fentanyl on the black market for illicit drugs is one of the factors contributing to overdose deaths caused by fentanyl.
在西非、中部非洲和北非，非医疗用途曲马多的市场已有大幅增长。	Tramadol's non-medical market has seen tremendous growth in West, Central, and North Africa.
在该区域，接受治疗的曲马多使用病症患者越来越多。	Tramadol use disorders are being treated on a growing number of patients in the area.
2017年，全球截获的曲马多数量显著增加，达到125吨以上的峰值。	In 2017, the amount of tramadol that was seized internationally peaked at more than 125 tons.
但2018年，在印度通过一项监管曲马多的新法律之后，全球缉获量降至32吨。	Global seizures, however, dropped to 32 tons in 2018 when India implemented a new rule governing tramadol.
促成这两地危机的是制造简单和生产成本低，此外还有对曲马多和许多芬太尼类似物或其前体缺乏国际监管。	The ease of production, low cost, and absence of international regulation of tramadol and several fentanyl analogs or their forerunners all contribute to the situation in both places.
使这两地危机恶化的是这些物质在药品市场和非法市场上都有供应，因而更加难以发现和防止其滥用。	The availability of these medications in both prescription and illegal markets, which makes it more challenging to identify and stop abuse, exacerbates the situation in both locations.
兴奋剂使用不断增多	An increase in doping use
兴奋剂领域以可卡因和甲基苯丙胺为主，这两种物质在其主要市场的使用量都在上升。	Cocaine and methamphetamine, which both have rising use in their key areas, dominate the stimulant market.
2018年使用可卡因的约有1,900万人，因为可卡因在北美和西欧颇为流行。	In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it is widely utilized in Western Europe and North America.
同年使用苯丙胺的约有2,700万人，其中甲基苯丙胺是东南亚和北美使用最多的苯丙胺类兴奋剂。	In the same year, 27 million people took amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most popular ATS in North America and South-East Asia.
根据所掌握的多数指标，20年来这两个区域甲基苯丙胺的使用一直在扩大。	Most indicators show that methamphetamine usage has been rising in both regions for the past 20 years.
在一些市场上，可卡因和甲基苯丙胺可以共存，有时是相互替代，这样一种药物的使用量上升时另一种药物的使用量就下降，有时是同时增加和减少以满足同一市场的需求。	Cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist in some markets, occasionally substituting for one another, causing the use of one drug to climb while the usage of the other lowers, or occasionally both rising and falling to satisfy demand in the same market.
新冠肺炎使注射吸毒者的风险增高	COVID-19 increases risk for injecting drug users
据估计，2018年注射吸毒的约有1,130万人，全球艾滋病毒感染约有10%是注射吸毒造成的。	In 2018, it was projected that 11,300 thousand people used injectable drugs, and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are linked to injecting drug usage.
注射吸毒者感染艾滋病毒的超过100万人，患丙型肝炎的有550万人。	HIV infects more than 1 million drug injectors, while hepatitis C affects 5,500 thousand.
2017年，因吸毒死亡的约有 58.5万人，其中一半死于丙型肝炎引起的肝病，而注射吸毒者的丙型肝炎大多仍未得到治疗。	Half of the estimated 0.585 million drug-related deaths in 2017 were attributable to liver illness brought on by hepatitis C, which is largely untreated among injecting drug users.
5 新冠肺炎限制措施造成的类阿片短缺可能导致使用者代之以酒精或苯二氮类药物等更容易获得的物质，或者将类阿片与合成药物混合。	5 Users may substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or combine opioids with synthetic narcotics as a result of opioid shortages brought on the COVID-19 regulations.
随着一些使用者改用注射或更频繁地注射，可能会出现更多有害的使用方式。	Some users switching to injections or injecting more regularly may lead to the emergence of more hazardous patterns of usage.

欧盟峰会为难民政策争论，欧盟官员：接收过程步步瓶颈-中新网	EU faces admission obstacles in refugee policy talks, says Chinanews com
欧盟峰会为难民政策争吵不休，欧盟官员：接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈	Conflicts over refugee policy at the EU summit amongst EU officials; obstacles at every stage of the admission process
【环球时报驻比利时特派记者 牛瑞飞】据法新社2月10日报道，在当天最新的一次欧盟峰会上，欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩表示，欧盟领导人同意就非法移民问题出台更严格的政策，以此更易于驱逐非法移民。	Global Times' Niu Ruifei reports tighter rules on illegal immigration enacted at the recent EU summit, according to President Ursula von der Leyen, deporting illegal immigrants is easier now.
据报道，欧盟此举是对欧洲日益增长的非法移民问题关注的回应，如今，欧盟的核心问题在于，最终能被遣返的非法移民人数很少。	The EU's action, according to reports, is a reaction to growing worries over illegal immigration in Europe, which is now the main cause of the EU's poor deportation rate of illegal immigrants.
根据峰会文件，欧盟领导人呼吁委员会“立即调动大量欧盟资金”，以基础设施和监视等手段加强外部边界。	EU leaders requested the Commission to "quickly mobilize substantial EU funding," including through infrastructure and monitoring, to bolster external borders, according to the summit document.
然而，欧盟与各成员国就围栏费用支付等问题争吵不休。	Yet, the EU and member states have clashed over matters including how to pay for the fence.
冯德莱恩一再表示，欧盟资金不会支付相关费用。	The expenditures will not be covered by EU funding, according to Von der Leyen.
但一些成员国的外交官员称，如果欧盟能分担外部边界沿线安装摄像头、瞭望塔和其他基础设施的部分，这将给各国腾出国家预算从而加快建设进程。	The installation of cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the EU's external borders would free up national funds and move along more quickly, according to diplomats in several member states.
欧洲Euractiv网站称，欧盟官员承认，难民接收过程每一步都存在瓶颈，有限的接收能力和成员国不堪重负的移民当局无法阻止难民在欧盟各国提交“无数”庇护申请，欧盟的难民接收系统处于近乎“永久性的危机”中。	EU authorities acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every stage of the refugee admission procedure, according to the European Euractiv website, a "Permanent Crisis."
据欧盟委员会估计，欧盟的申根国家去年收到超92万份庇护申请，比前一年增加近半。	According to estimates from the European Commission, the Schengen member states of the EU received more than 920,000 asylum claims in 2017—a nearly 50% rise from the year before.
与此同时，欧盟去年记录到超 33万次非法入境。	Almost 330,000 illicit entry were noted by the European Union last year.
在该背景下，此次峰会还就一项“原则”达成协议，即欧盟国家可根据另一个成员国的法院判决将非法移民遣返回国。	In light of this, the summit also adopted the "principle" that member states of the EU may remove unlawful immigrants in accordance with a court ruling in another member state.
此外，报道称，欧盟领导人还同意“增加对安全国家概念的使用”，这将为欧盟制定共同清单开辟道路。	The article also stated that EU leaders decided to "expand the use of the notion of a safe state," which will allow the EU to create a standard list.

美国升级“芯片战”重创全球半导体产业-中新网	US China's "chip war" hits global semiconductor industry
最近，美国对华“芯片战”大有升级之势——先是荷兰、日本两国在美国施压下，同意启动对华半导体制造设备出口的管制；后有外媒报道，美国政府正考虑切断美国供应商与华为公司之间的所有联系，禁止美国供应商向华为提供任何产品；拜登政府还准备公布一项行政命令，限制美国对敏感的中国科技行业的投资……2023年开年不久，美国在遏制中国半导体相关产业发展上就恶招不断。	US-China "chip war" to escalate, under US pressure, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to restrict semiconductor machinery exports to China, US may end all relations with Huawei & ban US use, ban on Huawei products, Biden admin ready to issue order limiting US, investment in sensitive C, 2023 is coming soon, the US continues to stifle China's semiconductor sectors.
近年来，美国打击中国“芯”发展的动作从未停歇，一边精准打压对华半导体产供链，一边构建“去中国化”的半导体产业链联盟，图谋在先进半导体产业上彻底“甩开”中国。	US sanctions limit China's semiconductor industry and create de-Sinicization alliance, none - "China" is already the shortest possible version of its name.
无论是拉拢韩国建立“技术同盟”，还是与韩国、日本和中国台湾地区建立芯片“四方联盟”，亦或借由美日印澳“四边机制”“印太经济框架”等机制建立半导体产业链“小圈子”，美国通过把政治化、阵营化、武器化的手段引入半导体产业，企图搭建美国主导的封闭产供链循环，从而弥补其在芯片制造领域的短板，维护其在全球芯片产业的优势地位。	Whether it be to convince South Korea to create a "specialized organization together," or to make a chip "quadrate alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or to set up a semiconductor industry chain through components such as the "four-party component" of the Joined together States, Japan, India, and Australia, and the "Indo-Pacific Financial System".
然而，美国大张旗鼓的对华“芯战术”，也是“伤敌一千自损八百”。	The US, however, also uses "harm to the enemy by one thousand and self-injury by eight hundred" as one of its "fundamental tactics" against China.
最近，美国知名芯片制造设备供应商泛林集团宣布，受最新一轮对华芯片制造设备出口禁令影响，集团将解雇1300名全职员工，未来两个季度还计划解雇1400名临时员工。	The recent round of export restrictions on chip manufacturing equipment to China have caused the Lam Group, a well-known supplier of chip manufacturing equipment in the United States, to announce that it will be forced to lay off 1,300 full-time employees and 1,400 temporary workers over the course of the next two quarters.
全球光刻机巨头荷兰阿斯麦控股公司最近警告，禁止向中国出口半导体制造设备，可能导致半导体价格上涨。	ASML, a leading manufacturer of lithography equipment worldwide, recently issued a warning that the Chinese export restriction on semiconductor production equipment would result in increased semiconductor pricing.
美媒分析，在美国政府对中国芯片和半导体等行业实施蛮横打压后，许多美国公司深受其害，包括电子设计自动化工具开发商、芯片设计商、晶圆制造设备生产商、芯片制造商本身等。	US companies that make electronic design automation tools, chips, and wafer manufacturing equipment suffered greatly when the US government suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries.
美国所谓打压中国先进半导体产业，却把全球半导体产业链、供应链拖下了水。	The worldwide semiconductor industry chain and supply chain have been negatively impacted by the alleged American suppression of China's sophisticated semiconductor industry.
半导体产业是高技术和知识密集型产业，早已形成联系紧密的全球半导体产业链。	The semiconductor industry is a high-tech, knowledge-intensive sector of the economy, and a globally interconnected chain of the semiconductor industry has long developed.
据专业人士估算，基于专业化分工，半导体产品的整个生产过程需要跨越各国边境70次以上，全程达到100天。	Using specialized division of labor, experts estimate that the complete production process for semiconductor devices requires crossing international borders more than 70 times and takes 100 days.
尽管美国半导体产业基础较强，但在制造能力特别是先进制程工艺上较为薄弱，严重依赖东亚地区。	Although the US semiconductor sector has a solid base, its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in terms of modern manufacturing techniques, are relatively limited, and it mainly depends on East Asia.
即便美国极力引导先进芯片产供链转向美国主导的“小圈子”区域化发展，但全球半导体相关产业的地区分布和相互依赖局面很难被改变。	It is difficult to modify the geographical distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries, even when the United States makes every effort to direct advanced chip production and the supply chain to the regional development of the "little circle" led by the United States.
美国强力“重塑”“去中国化”的半导体产业链，重创全球半导体产业。	The worldwide semiconductor industry has been seriously harmed by the United States' aggressive "reshaping" and "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain.
芯片是全球未来产业的核心，芯片产业的发展离不开全球各国共同参与。	The foundation of the global future industry is the chip, and the growth of the chip industry depends on the involvement of all nations in the globe.
近年来，美国采取一系列单边行动，相继出台《创新与竞争法案》《2022年美国竞争法案》《芯片和科学法案》，利用科技霸权，巩固本国技术领先优势；对盟友“恩威并施”，诱逼英特尔、台积电、三星等芯片制造企业赴美设厂，极力确保美国在芯片领域的全球领导地位。	The US passed 3 acts to reinforce its tech advantage: "Innovation and Competition Act," "American Competition Act of 2022," and "Chips and Science Act", It made chip manufacturers establish factories in the US and promoted US leadership in the industry.
短期看，美国确实给中国的芯片产业及相关产业发展制造了麻烦，收获了现实利益。	The United States has temporarily hampered the growth of China's semiconductor industry and associated sectors while also reaping substantial rewards.
但长期看，美国歇斯底里地打压，倒逼中国芯片产业不断突破，让自己失去了巨大的中国市场，最终会极大削弱美国科技企业的创新意愿和创新能力，损害全球芯片产业发展。	However, in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the US has forced China's chip industry to make constant advancements, depriving itself of the massive Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of US technology companies and harm the growth of the global chip industry.

健身行业应摆脱信任危机-中新网	Fitness industry must address trust crisis
又一大型健身房“暴雷”？	Yet another significant gym "thunderstorm"?
近日，知名健身机构中健健身会员维权问题引起社会关注。	Recently, concerns over the protection of members' rights by the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness have garnered public attention.
春节后不少会员发现自己所在门店没有正常营业，随后，关于该机构倒闭跑路的传闻引起会员恐慌，导致公安、人社部门介入。	Members found their stores faulty since Spring Festival, group members panicked over rumors of closure, prompting intervention from safety, HR, and social security departments.
最后，该机构相关负责人出面回应，承诺会努力保障好员工和会员的合法权益，风波才得以平息。	In the end, the organization's relevant chief executive promised to make great efforts to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers and members, and the uproar died down.
个别健身机构的部分门店出现经营问题，暂时关闭，消费者本可心平气和等待问题解决，为何不少会员的第一反应是“大事不妙”？	Fitness stores in financial trouble are closed for now, customers can be patient, "Why is 'not good' common among members' responses?"
健身俱乐部会员维权风波背后，是行业信任危机的深层次问题。	The crisis of industry trust is the root cause of the controversy surrounding the protection of fitness club members' rights.
国内传统健身房普遍采取预付费模式，“赚用户不来的钱”是其发展的底层逻辑。	Conventional domestic gyms often use a prepaid model, and their evolution was motivated by "making money from users who can't come."
通过预售会员卡获取现金流，不断开新店，看似能够循环往复，实则寅吃卯粮，无法形成稳定的盈利模式。	Although it appears that the process of generating cash flow by pre-selling membership cards and building additional locations on a regular basis may be repeated, it is actually hard to establish a sustainable business model.
健身房跑路等行业负面信息频频传出，对消费者信心造成强烈冲击。	Consumer confidence is significantly impacted by the widespread distribution of unfavorable information about sectors like running in the gym.
从市场前景看，健身房当然算得上是一门有“钱途”的好生意。	Of course, gyms might be seen as a good business with "money potential" from the perspective of market prospects.
健身赛道虽然起起伏伏，但始终受到资本关注。	The fitness track has had its ups and downs, but capital has always been interested in it.
多项数据显示，文体消费等领域热度不断攀升，市场持续回暖。	Many statistics demonstrate that the market is still growing and that consumption in the arts, sports, and other professions is becoming more and more popular.
具体到健身市场，随着居民生活水平稳步提高，健康生活理念深入人心，健身行业发展大有可为。	With regard to the fitness market, there is a lot of room for growth given the steadily rising living standards of locals and the widespread acceptance of the value of a healthy lifestyle.
形势越是趋好，行业越需重视发展质量。	The requirement for the industry to focus on development quality increases as the situation improves.
然而，个别机构对消费复苏后的健身市场盲目乐观，刚从危机中走出来，又吹响开疆拓土的号角，把融资资金一股脑投入新店建设上。	Despite consumption recovery, some institutions were overly optimistic about the fitness market and invested all financing funds in new store construction. 5x5
不可否认，这几年受疫情影响，不少机构退出，行业重新洗牌，有实力的企业此时选择性地加大收购力度、重新布局，未尝不是新机遇。	The epidemic led to institutions withdrawing and business restructuring, big firms are restructuring and acquiring selectively, not a new opportunity.
但是，健身市场发展要想进入良性循环，迈上行稳致远的康庄大道，行业就必须改变传统模式，改变经营策略。	But, the sector must alter the conventional model and its business strategy if it hopes to enter a positive feedback loop and follow a steady and long-term course.
只有稳扎稳打，重新建立起消费者的信任度、安全感，才能真正赢得市场、赢得未来。	We can only genuinely win the market and the future by working consistently and regaining the confidence and security of consumers.
相比大建新店抢占市场，健身行业当前更需要的是沉下心来优化服务，用高质量发展来稳住用户。	The fitness business needs to settle down to maximize services and stabilize users with high-quality development, as opposed to opening additional locations to capture the market.
首先，要靠服务留住用户。	To keep users, it is first vital to rely on services.
健身房属于服务行业，其本质是坚持“用户导向”，要紧紧围绕用户需求，把经营重心放在服务提质升级上。	The essence of the service sector, which includes the gyms, is to uphold "user orientation," pay special attention to customer needs, and improve service quality.
其次，要靠数字化转型提升用户体验。	To enhance user experience, second, rely on digital transformation.
比如当下流行的互联网健身房模式，实现用户按次付费和场地自选。	For instance, the current and widely used Internet gym model allows consumers to pay per view and select their own locations.
同时，身体数据、运动数据得以有效利用，还可以满足社交需求，实现从线上到线下完整的服务闭环。	Body data and sports data can be used to address societal demands and create a seamless closed-loop service from online to offline at the same time.
没有私教推销，没有巨额年卡，用户对健身机构“跑路”的担忧降低了，信任感也就提升了。	Users are less concerned about "running away" from exercise facilities because there is no personal training promotion and no large annual card, and their sense of trust has also increased.
另外，还要积极探索多元业态。	Also, we need to actively investigate other business forms.
如今，体育消费已经从单一服务走向场景消费，健身俱乐部有望成为消费新入口，围绕健身所需的运动补给和健身器械等周边产品或将成为新的盈利点，为消费者提供更丰富选择。	Nowadays, watching sports is more like watching a scenario than just one service, fitness centers are anticipated to emerge as new points of access for consumers, sports gear and fitness equipment are examples of peripheral goods that could develop into new profit centers and give consumers more options.

买贵退差价！	Buy cost distinction discounted!
南京楼市再现“差价赔付”-中新网	The Nanjing genuine domain showcase is back, "paying for cost contrast," concurring to Chinanews com
扬子晚报讯(记者 马祚波)扬子晚报/紫牛新闻记者10日在采访中发现，十余年未见的“保价协议”又重回了南京楼市，位于江北新区的一家楼盘宣称“差价赔付”，在交房前其他房源的优惠大于之前的折扣，开发商愿意为买房人换房并退还差价。	Evening News in Yangzi (Correspondent Ma Zuobo) In an meet on the 10th, a Yangzi Evening News/Ziniu News columnist learned that the "cost ensure understanding," which had not been seen within the Nanjing genuine bequest showcase for more than ten a long time, had returned, the developer is willing to form changes to the domestic for the client and repay the contrast on the off chance that, some time recently the domestic is conveyed, the markdown advertised by other lodging sources is greater than the past rebate.
“保价协议”条件可不少	The "ensured estimating assention" is subject to a number of requirements
这家位于江北新区的楼盘名为保利扬子萃云台，看房人孙先生告诉记者，他在上周末逛楼盘时发现了一则“声明”。	Poly Yangzi Cuiyun Patio is the title of this piece of genuine domain in Jiangbei Unused Area, the watcher, Mr Sun, educated columnists that he found a "articulation" final end of the week whereas trying to find genuine bequest.
他发给记者的图片上显示，该楼盘的开发商承诺，凡是在2月1日-2月28日期间购买房源的，自双方签订买卖合同之日起至对应房源交付，若该项目其他房源的优惠折扣大于之前购房所享折扣的(限与该商品房属于同一户型、同一楼栋、同一单元、同一物业类型的其他未售商品房)，开发商可以为购房者换房并退还差价。	Agreeing to the picture he sent to the columnist, the genuine domain designer ensures that anybody who obtains a domestic between February 1 and February 28 would start tallying down from the day the two parties sign the deals contract until the conveyance of the coordinating domestic, the designer may substitute a diverse domestic for the buyer and discount the contrast on the off chance that the special markdown of other unsold commercial homes is more noteworthy than the rebate delighted in by the earlier domestic buy (limited to other unsold commercial homes of the same sort, same building, same unit, and same property sort as the commercial domestic).
孙先生表示，置业顾问表示这其实就是一份“保价协议”，目的是让买家放心出手，不用担心开发企业降价促销，“现在就怕买完了它就降价了，去售楼处闹吧没时间，不闹的话也确实窝心”。	The objective of this "cost assurance understanding," agreeing to Mr Sun's genuine domain expert, is to supply buyers peace of intellect and anticipate them from stressing almost the improvement company's price diminishments, time, you're inconceivably charming given you do not cause trouble.
还有不少买房人则认为，“保价协议”虽然是在给购房者吃“定心丸”，不过条件却不低。	Indeed in spite of the fact that the "cost security understanding" is assumed to donate buyers "certainty," numerous planned property holders still think the terms are not favorable.
打算在江北买一套刚需房的郑女士说，保价的房源首先是要同一户型，还得在同一楼栋、同一个单元，买家可以比价的房源寥寥，因此“门槛”还是蛮高的。	Concurring to Ms Zheng, who plans to buy a modern domestic in Jiangbei, the price-insured domestic must to begin with be of the same sort, housed within the same complex, and be within the same flat, since there are so few homes accessible for comparison, the "edge" is still reasonably tall, of.
也有购房者认为，由于信息不对称，销售时不排除给出额外的让利，买家“维权”的难度不小。	A few buyers too think that it is troublesome for them to "protect their rights" since of information asymmetry, which extra concessions may be made amid the exchange.
能否留住买房人有待观察	It remains to be seen on the off chance that it can hold clients
记者在南京网上房地产上查询得知，该楼盘于去年11月首领两幢楼共计252套房源的销许，户型面积有105平方米、114平方米、129平方米等，全装修销许均价为39843元/㎡。	Online inquire about by the correspondent uncovered that 252 suites in two buildings in Nanjing were sold in add up to in November of final year, 39843 yuan/m2 is the taken a toll.
不过两个多月过去，网上房地产显示目前该楼盘的未售总套数为157套，占比为62.3%，其中8号楼共计128套，未售套数达113套，7号楼的124套中也有44套未售，项目的总成交套数只有33套，占比仅为13%。	Online genuine domain information, in any case, uncovers that more than two months afterward, 157 units—or 62.3%—of the building's total—remain unsold, additionally, 44 units stay unsold, and fair 33 sets, or 13%, of the project's add up to deals, have been completed.
市场人士介绍，“保价协议”在2008年也曾在南京出现过。	Advertise sources claim that in 2008, the "cost security assention" moreover emerged in Nanjing.
当年8月份，河西黄山路上的楼盘横塘西苑为了吸引买房人眼球，推出了《保价计划》，具体内容为“公司郑重承诺，若一年内项目优惠幅度扩大，由此产生的差额，公司将按差额退还给老业主”。	In an exertion to allure homebuyers, Hengtang Xiyuan, a genuine domain improvement on Huangshan Street in Hexi, presented the "Cost Ensure Arrange" in Admirable of that year, to the past proprietor, return the contrast.
此后2011年4月，南京也有9家楼盘拿出部分房源承诺“差价赔付”。	In any case, in April 2011, nine Nanjing genuine domain postings expelled a parcel of their advertisements and made a commitment to "compensate for the cost disparity."

北京师范大学传播创新与未来媒体实验平台此前发布了《电商行业内容生态健康指数(ECHI)报告》，从数据维度解析了当前电商行业中“新变量”——优质内容的重要性，运用指数对国内27家主流电商平台内容生态情况进行了评估。	The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform at Beijing Normal University has published a report called the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) Report", The report focuses on the importance of high-quality content in the current e-commerce sector and rates the content ecology of 27 domestic mainstream e-commerce platforms.
根据上述报告的电商行业内容生态健康指数排名，抖音电商、快手、淘宝、拼多多、京东位居前五。	The top five e-commerce retailers based on their content ecological health index are Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD com.
报告认为，电商行业内容生态是一个综合性概念，是将电商与内容进行整合，但并非所有内容都可与电商整合，好的PGC(专业生产内容)与UGC(用户原创内容)才是与电商进行整合的优质载体，内容平台价值越高，消费与推广的场景也就越来越丰富，电商植入的可能性也就越高，商业价值也就越强，这种公共领域和私人领域逐步集成分布的电商内容生产和内容消费的比例也就会越高。	The article suggests that while not all content is relevant to e-commerce, there is a strong connection between e-commerce and content, user-generated and professional content can serve as a valuable tool for integrating e-commerce, the more opportunities for consumption and promotion, the more valuable the content platform becomes, as the distinction between public and private domains becomes less clear, there will be an increase in e-commerce content development and consumption.

他表示，就内容价值而言，当前电商行业已经从“消费可及性”过渡到“消费品质化”阶段，优质、专业、差异化的内容是电商行业的“硬通货”。	According to him, the contemporary e-commerce sector has moved from "consumption accessibility" to "consumption quality" in terms of content value, and high-quality, expert, and distinctive material is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce sector.
同时，内容成为电商发展新阶段的根本和抓手，知识付费、专业性知识、KOL(关键意见领袖)等PGC内容开始在电商直播中成为标配。	At the same time, PGC content such knowledge payments, professional knowledge, and KOL (Key Opinion Leader) has started to become the norm in e-commerce live broadcasts, serving as the cornerstone and launch point of the future stage of e-commerce development.
展望电商行业的未来发展，喻国明提出两方面的建议。	Yu Guoming made two recommendations in anticipation of the e-commerce sector's future growth.
一个是从内容结构提升的角度看，推动电商内容生态健康程度和质量整体提升，打造正向内容创作和管理标准，实现电商行业内容生态健康系统指数与动态均衡。	The first is to encourage the general improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of content structure improvement, develop positive standards for content creation and management, and achieve the index and dynamic balance of the e-commerce industry content ecological health system.
另一个是从外部生态看，要实现内容电商行业的健康发展和外部环境的价值协同与共创。	From the standpoint of external ecology, it is important to realize the healthy development of the content e-commerce sector as well as the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
“未来电商行业还需要更多的数据、人工智能方面的支持，形成对未来发展稳定性的预测；此外，为商家提供更规范、健康的成长空间，实现电商行业中企业、用户、产品与服务的价值协同，共创健康内容生态。	To ensure stability and growth in the e-commerce sector, data and artificial intelligence will be crucial, this will create a standardized and healthy environment for businesses, consumers, and products to integrate, the focus should be on developing a strong content ecosystem that emphasizes the value of services.

既在发展中更多考虑安全因素，通过发展提升国家安全实力，运用发展成果来夯实国家安全的基础，又善于营造有利于经济社会发展的安全环境，不断激发发展活力，实现高质量发展和高水平安全的良性互动。	We should consider security factors more in development, enhance national security capabilities through development, use the fruits of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and create a favorable security environment for economic and social development, continuously stimulating development vitality, and achieving a virtuous interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
推进中国式现代化，既要坚持走自己的路，又要拓展世界眼光，坚持对外开放，不断拓展中国式现代化的广度和深度。	To advance China's modernization in a Chinese way, we must adhere to our own path while broadening our global perspective, persist in opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of China's modernization.
要坚持独立自主、自立自强，坚持把国家和民族发展放在自己力量的基点上，坚持把我国发展进步的命运牢牢掌握在自己手中。	We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, placing the development of our country and nation on the foundation of our own strength, and firmly grasp the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
要不断扩大高水平对外开放，深度参与全球产业分工和合作，用好国内国际两种资源，拓展中国式现代化的发展空间，在互利共赢中共享发展机遇、共创美好未来。	We must continuously expand high-level opening-up, actively participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, broaden the development space of China's modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future through mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.

Google AI聊天机器人“答错问题” 母公司股价蒸发千亿美元	Google AI chatbot 'answers the wrong questions', parent company's stock price drops by $100 billion
（综合11日电）	(General 11)
Google新推出的人工智能聊天机器人Bard出师不利，在宣传短片中“答错问题”，导致Google母公司Alphabet股价周三一度急挫8.9%，跌破100美元大关，市值蒸发1100亿美元（约4765亿令吉），截至周五闭市报94.57美元。	Google's new artificial intelligence chat robot Bard got off to a bad start and "answered the wrong question" in the promotional video, causing Google's parent company Alphabet's stock price to plummet 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, and its market value evaporated by $110 billion (approximately 4765 billion ringgit), at US$94.57 as of Friday’s close.
市场担心Alphabet不及竞争对手微软。	The market is concerned that Alphabet may not be able to compete with its rival, Microsoft.
根据《路透社》报道，google较早时在社交媒体发布AI聊天机器人Bard的宣传短片，片中有人询问Bard：“我可以告诉我9岁的孩子关于James Webb太空望远镜 (JWST) 的哪些新发现？	According to Reuters, Google earlier released a promotional video for Bard, an AI chatbot, on social media in which Bard is asked, "What can I tell my 9-year-old about the new discoveries of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?
”Bard在回答中提到该望远镜曾拍摄到太阳系外行星的第一张照片。	In its response, Bard mentioned that the telescope had captured the first-ever photograph of an exoplanet outside our solar system."
不过，根据美国国家航空航天局资料，太阳系外行星的第一张照片是由欧洲南方天文台的“甚大望远镜”于2004年所拍。	However, according to data from NASA, the first photograph of an exoplanet outside our solar system was actually taken by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
《路透社》更以“Bard回答错误后Alphabet股价暴跌”为题报道。	Reuters reported with the headline "Alphabet stock plunges after Bard gives incorrect answer."
另一方面，Google指出，Bard的回应“突显了严格测试过程的重要性”，会把外部反馈与自己的内部测试结合起来，以确保Bard的回应“在质量、安全和真实信息的基础上达到高标准”。	On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlighted the importance of rigorous testing processes" and stated that they would combine external feedback with their internal testing to ensure that Bard's responses "meet high standards in terms of quality, safety, and accurate information."

金正恩父女互动亲密 老婆遭冷落一旁	Kim Jong-un's father and daughter interact intimately, but his wife is ignored
（综合11日电）朝鲜8日晚间举行建军节第75周年阅兵仪式，领导人金正恩的女儿金主爱不仅出席，还与父亲一同站上主席台。	"(General 11) - North Korea held a military parade on the 75th anniversary of Army Day on the evening of the 8th, and leader Kim Jong-un's daughter Kim Jong-ae not only attended but also stood on the podium together with her father."
朝鲜官媒9日公布影片，金主爱依偎在父亲身边，数次温情对视、讲悄悄话，她用双手轻捧老爸的脸颊，甚至摸著父亲胸口，父女互动画面播送至举国上下。	The official media of the DPRK released a video on the 9th, the main love of Kim nestled next to her father, several times warm look at each other, whispering, she gently cupped her father's cheeks with both hands, and even touched his chest, father-daughter interaction images broadcast to the whole country.
然而，第一夫人李雪主只能退到一旁。	However, the First Lady, Ri Sol-ju, could only step aside.
综合韩国“朝鲜新闻”等报导，金正恩、李雪主夫妇7日带著女儿金主爱出席晚宴的官方合照中，金主爱不仅罕见坐在父母正中间C位，在隔日晚间建军节第75周年阅兵仪式上，她还与金正恩一起登上主席台。	Based on South Korean "North Korea News" and other reports, in the official group photo of Kim Jong-un and Li Xuezhu with their daughter Kim Joo-ae attending the dinner on the 7th, Kim Joo-ae is not only rarely sitting in the Center seat between her parents, but also on the 75th anniversary of the Army Day the next night at the military parade, she also stood on the rostrum with Kim Jong-un.
朝鲜官媒“朝鲜中央电视台”事后释出阅兵式影片，曝光了更多父女情深的画面。	After the military parade, the official North Korean media, the "Korean Central Television," released a video showing more intimate moments between Kim Jong-un and his daughter.
金正恩在主席台上数次与女儿对望，两人脸上的笑容从未退去，还互相在耳边讲悄悄话，金主爱一度以双手捧起老爸的两颊，金正恩也以灿笑回应。	Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium, the smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered in each other's ears at one point, Kim Joo-ae cupped his father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
其他官媒画面也显示，金主爱与金正恩坐在室内沙发椅上时，用手不断摸著父亲的脸；她与父亲挽著手走路时，一边用手摸在金正恩的胸口。	Other official media footage also shows Kim Jong-ae touching her father's face with her hand while sitting on a sofa chair in the room with Kim Jong-un; she touches her hand on Kim Jong-un's chest while walking arm-in-arm with her father.
而第一夫人李雪主全程只能走在后头或是坐在一旁，总是距离丈夫和女儿有几步之差。	The first lady, Li Xuezhu, could only walk behind or sit aside, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
韩国媒体指出，金主爱自去年11月18日试射火星17飞弹首次在公开露脸以来，3个月以来曝光机率越来越高，至今已是第5度出现于正式场合。	The South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Joo-ae made his first public appearance on November 18 last year during the test launch of the Mars-17 missile, the exposure rate has increased over the past three months, and has now appeared on official occasions for the fifth time.
朝鲜官媒提及金主爱时使用了最亲爱的子弟、尊贵的子弟等极高尊称，也播出金主爱在看台上俯瞰阅兵行进时反覆高喊誓死拥护白头血统的片段。	The official media of the DPRK referred to Kim Jong-ae with high honorific titles such as dearest son and honored son, and also broadcast a clip of Kim Jong-ae repeatedly shouting his pledge to uphold the white head bloodline while overlooking the parade march from the stands.
这些迹象让外界怀疑金主爱是否已经被内定为金氏政权的继承人，《华盛顿邮报》分析认为“这是金正恩把中学年纪的女儿推上接班人地位的讯号”，不过也有观点认为，这样的判断仍为时过早，在金正恩膝下有儿子的情况中，仍保有各种可能性。	The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a sign that Kim Jong-un is putting his middle-school-aged daughter in the position of successor," but some believe that it is still too early to tell, as there are still various possibilities for Kim Jong-un to have a son at his side.
重阳问答︱如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	Chongyang Q&A ︱ How do you think the US January non-farm payrolls data greatly exceeded expectations and future trends -
Q：请问重阳投资，如何看待美国1月非农就业数据大超预期及未来趋势？	Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, what do you think of the US non-agricultural employment data in January exceeding expectations and the future trend?
A：2月3日美国劳工部公布2023年1月非农就业数据，新增非农就业51.7万人，大幅高于市场预期的18.9万人；失业率降至3.4%，为近50年以来的最低位；时薪同比增速4.4%，环比增速0.3%，略有放缓。	A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 nonfarm payrolls data, adding 517,000 new nonfarm jobs, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly earnings grew at a slightly slower rate of 4.4% year-over-year and 0.3% year-over-year.
从总量上来看，本次数据存在很多一次性和技术性因素的扰动，比如罢工返岗的教职工、调查统计口径的修正、季调因子的更新，后续可能将有所修正（参考2022年1月新增非农由50.4万人下修至36.4万人），非农就业或不像数据体现的那样强劲。	In terms of overall figures, this data may be influenced by several one-time and technical factors, such as the return of striking teachers to work, revisions in survey statistical methods, and updates in seasonal adjustment factors. There could be subsequent revisions to the data (as seen in January 2022 when the initial figure of 504,000 new non-farm jobs was later revised down to 364,000 jobs). Therefore, the non-farm employment situation may not be as robust as the data initially suggests.
从结构上来看，高科技企业裁员影响仍在，但占比较低；高接触性服务业如休闲酒店、教育保健等新增就业大幅回升，数据显示服务业劳动力缺口仍存。	From the structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but it accounts for a lower percentage; new employment in high-touch services such as leisure and hotel, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and the data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
结合同样大超预期的服务业PMI、岗位空缺和劳动力缺口数据的回升和消费信贷数据的强势，我们判断经过极端天气和节假日后美国服务业迎来了快速修复。	Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies, and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
我们认为，在不经过衰退的情况下美国就业市场的供需紧张难以改善。	We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US job market will hardly improve without going through a recession.
目前美国劳动力市场尚有500余万的供给缺口，而劳动参与率上行缓慢，尤其是25-54岁劳动参与率已经接近疫情前高点。	There is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor force participation rate is moving slowly upward, especially for 25-54 year olds, which is already near its pre-epidemic high.
除此之外，由于美国居民超额储蓄和消费信贷的强势，消费需求的强劲将促使紧缩政策对就业市场的影响进一步滞后。	In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
美国就业市场供需持续紧张将是2023年美国经济的底色。	The ongoing tightness in the US job market's supply and demand will be a prevailing characteristic of the US economy in 2023.
叠加目前临近加息结束，通胀预期不断反复，我们对薪资增速的持续下降并不乐观。	Considering the impending end of interest rate hikes and the continuous fluctuations in inflation expectations, we are not optimistic about the sustained decline in wage growth.
本次数据公布前，美国股债汇市场对于美联储加息路径的预期过于乐观。	Prior to the release of this data, the US stock, bond, and currency markets had overly optimistic expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's path of interest rate hikes.
随着通胀数据的持续改善，美联储在缩短加息步伐的同时还不断维系着市场通胀预期脆弱的平衡，但市场对于美联储偏向鹰派的表述视而不见，不仅预期提前停止加息，还预期年末两次降息。	As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has continued to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statements, expecting not only an early halt to rate hikes, but also two year-end rate cuts.
在劳动力市场供需紧张，紧缩政策影响不明的情况下，我们认为美联储年末对于加息的指引是相对合理的，市场极端预期的调整和交易的拥挤或将对市场产生一定伤害。	In the case of tight labor market supply and demand, the impact of tightening policy is unknown, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance on rate hikes is relatively reasonable, the adjustment of extreme market expectations and the crowded trading may cause some harm to the market.
尽管如此，薪资增速的顽固难改当前通胀快速下降的趋势，随着M2数据同比转负以及各个CPI分项领先指标的逐渐转好，自10月份以来美国CPI数据已经转向快速下降阶段，薪资增速的顽固仅会对以后的通胀数据形成托底，当前的市场预期难以证伪，在下一期通胀数据公布后市场或进入新一轮博弈。	Nevertheless, the stubbornness of payroll growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of each CPI sub-leading indicators, since October the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline in the phase, the stubbornness of payroll growth will only form the bottom of future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, the market may enter a new round of gaming after the next release of inflation data.
杉杉创始人郑永刚因突发心脏疾病过世 曾带领中国服装第一股转型 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	"Founder of Sugo Zheng Yonggang passed away due to sudden heart disease, once led the transformation of China's first garment stock - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website”
经济观察网 记者 郑淯心 2月11日，认证主体为杉杉控股有限公司（以下简称“杉杉控股 ” ） 的微信公众号发布讣告，杉杉企业创始人、杉杉控股董事局主席郑永刚因突发心脏疾病救治无效，于2023年2月10日去世，享年65岁。	Economic Observer Network reporter Zheng Yuxin on February 11, announced through a WeChat official account affiliated with Suning Holdings Group Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Suning Holdings") that Suning's founder and Chairman of the Board of Suning Holdings, Zheng Yonggang, passed away on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65, due to the ineffectiveness of emergency treatment for a sudden heart disease.
上世纪80年代，郑永刚担任国营棉纺厂的厂长，随着调任，1989年郑永刚成为杉杉股份的前身宁波云港服装总厂的厂长。	In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-run cotton spinning factory. With the transfer, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Sugo Corporation, in 1989
2022年12月，在第二十届中国企业领袖年会暨第二十二届中国企业未来之星年会上，郑永刚在演讲中称，在上世纪90年代的中国西服市场，杉杉品牌的市占率曾高达37 % 。	In December 2022, during the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Conference and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Annual Conference, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, Suning brand had a market share of up to 37%.
1996年杉杉股份（600884.SH）上市，成为中国服装业第一家上市公司。	In 1996, Sansun (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
就在服装业务如日中天时，杉杉集团却开始转型，因为郑永刚意识到 ， “ 一旦市场放开，中国品牌自然会形成一个梯队式品牌市场，杉杉西服想一直独领风骚，长期成为国人的国服的可能性不大 ” 。	While the garment business was booming, the Sugo Group began to transform because Zheng realized that "once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market, and it is unlikely that Sugo suits will always lead the way and become the national costume of the country in the long run.
1999年，杉杉开始研究企业转型，郑永刚回忆当年 ， “ 我们来到上海，寻求到底转型做什么，专门找了很多专家学者，连续不断地开一些诸葛亮会、务虚研讨会。	In 1999, Sugo began to study the transformation of the enterprise, Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "we came to Shanghai to seek what to do in the end transformation, specifically to find a lot of experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings, retreat seminars.
最后，我们设定了两个大的战略方向。	In the end, we set two major strategic directions.
第一个方向是新能源新材料，另外一个是大健康有未来 ” 。	The first direction was new energy and new materials, and the other was the future of the health industry.
战略方向确定后，杉杉开始寻找合作，那时候鞍山热能院为鞍钢配套的炭素研究所在做国家863课题，科研经费不够，于是杉杉和鞍山热能院碳素研究所签署合作协议，共同推动国家863课题“中间相炭微球”项目产业化，从事负极材料的研发、生产和销售，在国内实现负极材料的商用推广。	After the strategic direction was determined, Sugo started to look for cooperation, and at that time, the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute was doing the national 863 project for Anshan Iron and Steel, and the research funds were not enough, so Sugo and the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "intermediate phase carbon microspheres" and engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, so as to realize the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.
2001年，杉杉股份实现中间相炭微球的规模化生产，开始国产化替代，取代日本成为国内中间相炭微球主要供应商。	In 2001, Suning Corporation achieved large-scale production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres and began domestic substitution, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres in the domestic market.
这是中国第一家锂离子电池负极材料生产企业，实现了锂离子电池负极材料国产化。	Indeed, this made Suning Corporation the first Chinese production enterprise for lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials, thus achieving the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials in China.
随着锂电池的应用迅速普及，杉杉股份的锂电池业务开始逐步发展，2007年锂电材料业务被写入了杉杉股份的主营业务，服装业务营收占比逐年减少，直至2013年，杉杉股份的锂电材料业务收入全面超过服装业务。	With the rapid popularity of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugo began to develop gradually and In 2007, the lithium materials business was written into the main business of Sugo, and the revenue share of the garment business decreased year by year until 2013, the revenue of the lithium materials business of Sugo fully exceeded that of the garment business.
2021年2月，杉杉股份成功并购LG化学偏光片业务，进军LCD偏光片市场，并成立偏光片企业杉金光电，该领域技术含量比较高，杉杉的主要的竞争对手都是世界500强，如韩国三星、日本的住友化学、日东电工。	In February 2021, Sugo successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer enterprise Sugo Gold Optoelectronics, which is a relatively high technology field, and Sugo's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, Nitto Denko.
郑永刚曾分享过投后管理的心得 ， “ 中国的民营企业收购国际上的一些高科技企业，成功概率比较低，为什么那些收购会失败？	Zheng Yonggang has shared his insights on post-investment management, "The probability of success of Chinese private companies acquiring some international high-tech companies is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail?
因为大家都会去考虑，我花了那么多钱，我得去派人管对吧，这是通常会做的一个行为 ” ， 然而郑永刚则不同，杉杉收购成功的那一天，郑永刚就到杉金光电当众宣布，杉杉作为杉金的大股东，决定实施一企两制，除了郑永刚担任董事长，杉杉企业的人不派到杉金，采取授权经营的方式，原有的分配制度、企业文化、各项管理等模式不变。	Because everyone will go to consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people to manage, right, which is usually done an act ", however, Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Sugo, Zheng Yonggang went to Sugo Gold Optoelectronics announced in public, Sugo as the majority shareholder of Sugo Gold, decided to implement a two-enterprise system, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, Sugo enterprise people are not sent to Sugo Gold, to adopt the way of authorized operation, the original distribution system, corporate culture, the management model remains unchanged.
ICC鑫椤资讯发布2022年负极数据显示，杉杉负极2022年出货量突破20万吨，同比增幅100 % ， 市场份额达16 % ， 人造石墨负极材料出货量蝉联榜首。	ICC Xinfern information released 2022 negative electrode data shows that the shipment of Sugo negative electrode in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, with a year-on-year increase of 100 % and a market share of 16 %, and the shipment of artificial graphite negative electrode material topped the list.
在偏光片业务方面，Yano Research统计显示，公司旗下杉金光电2022年全球市场份额达到29 % ， 预计2023年市场份额将达到32 % ， 持续位列全球第一。	In the polarizer business, according to Yano Research, the company's Sugene Optoelectronics will reach a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
2022年前三季度，杉杉股份的营收为158.41亿元，净利润为23.13亿元，2月10日，杉杉股份的股价为19.24元/股，总市值为436亿元。	On the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Corporation revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, Shanshan Corporation share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan
2月9日，杉杉股份在互动平台表示，2022年底，公司石墨化有效产能约10万吨，眉山项目的石墨化产能尚在爬坡中。	On February 9, Suning Corporation stated on an interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite capacity was approximately 100,000 tons, and the graphite capacity of the Meishan project was still ramping up.
万得显示，目前郑永刚仍为杉杉股份的董事长和实际控制人。	According to Wind Information, Zheng Yonggang is still listed as the Chairman and actual controller of Suning Corporation.
天眼查显示，郑永刚持有杉杉控股有限公司的总股权比例是40.1 % 。	According to the SkyEye search, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1 % of the total equity of Sugo Holdings Co.

“基金E账户”来了：证监会授权开发 投资者名下所有基金实现归集和查询 - 经济观察网 － 专业财经新闻网站	"Fund E Account" is here: China Securities Regulatory Commission authorizes the development of all funds under the investor's name to achieve collection and query - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
经济观察网 记者 陈姗 基金购买渠道繁杂导致账户信息归集不易？	Economic Observer reporter Chen Shan, Is it difficult to collect account information due to the complicated purchase channels of funds?
总是遗忘“小金库”？	Always forgetting about the "small treasury"?
基民的这些问题即将得到解决。	The issues faced by fund investors are about to be resolved.
2月10日，证监会公告称，“基金E账户”APP在各手机应用商店上架并开展公开试运行。	On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced that the "Fund E-account" app has been made available on various mobile app stores and is undergoing public trial operation.
据介绍，“基金E账户”为个人投资者提供公募基金账户及份额信息的“一站式”查询服务，旨在解决广大中小投资者遗忘账户、查询繁琐等行业服务痛点。	According to the introduction, "Fund E Account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" inquiry service for public fund account and share information, aiming to solve the majority of small and medium-sized investors forget account, cumbersome inquiries and other industry service pain points.
据Wind数据显示，截至2022年底，国内共有公募基金管理人156家，管理基金规模约26万亿元；公募基金份额登记机构167家，公募基金销售机构411家。	According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, managing a fund size of about 26 trillion yuan; 167 public fund share registrars and 411 public fund sales institutions.
各份额登记机构账户体系相互独立，缺乏行业统一的查询渠道。	Each share registration institution has its own independent account system, and there is a lack of industry-wide unified channels for querying information.
有行业人士表示，2021年末我国基金投资者超过7.2亿人，也就是说，全国有一半人都投资了基金产品。	Some people in the industry said that by the end of 2021, there will be more than 720 million fund investors in my country. This means that half of the people in the country have invested in fund products.
此前，投资者需要通过不同销售机构查询购买情况，而通过“基金E账户”可以查询所有销售渠道购买的情况，持有基金情况一目了然。	Previously, investors had to check their purchases through different sales institutions, but through "Fund E Account", they can check their purchases from all sales channels and see their fund holdings at a glance.
“基金E账户”APP是什么？	What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
据相关文件介绍，“基金E账户”APP 是中国结算经中国证监会批准开发建设的公募基金行业门户手机应用，可为投资者提供全市场公募基金产品场外份额持有情况的一站式查询。	According to relevant documents, the "Fund E-account" app is a mobile application developed and constructed by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (ChinaClear) with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
投资者可以通过“基金E账户”方便、快捷地掌握自己通过全市场各销售渠道购买的各基金管理人旗下公募基金产品场外份额的持有情况，全面提升查询效率。	Through "Fund E Account", investors can easily and quickly grasp their holdings of OTC shares of each fund manager's public fund products purchased through various sales channels in the market, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of inquiries.
具体来说，投资者可以通过“基金E账户”查询到的信息包括：在全市场各公募基金管理人处开立的基金账户信息、在公募基金销售机构处开立的交易账户信息以及持有的包括公开募集证券投资基金以及证券公司设立管理的投资者人数不受200人限制的集合资产管理计划等产品的场外份额持有情况。	Specifically, investors can use the "Fund E-account" app to access various information, including their fund account information opened with fund management companies across the entire market, transaction account information opened with public fund sales institutions, and holdings of off-exchange shares of publicly offered securities investment funds, as well as collective asset management plans that are not limited to 200 investors and managed by securities firms.
上海证券基金评价研究中心业务负责人刘亦千向经济观察网记者表示，投资者可以通过“基金E账户”App一站式获知其所有的场外公募基金持有情况，帮助其找回“被遗忘的资产”，更重要的是为客户实现了综合基金投资情况的全账户信息归集，帮助客户更及时、准确、完整的掌握自身投资情况，从而更好地优化自身的基金组合配置，更好地规划自身的财务安排。	Liu Yichan, business leader of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told the Economic Observer that investors can get one-stop information about all their OTC public fund holdings through the "Fund E Account" app, which helps them find their "forgotten assets", and more importantly, it realizes comprehensive fund investment information collection for customers, which helps them grasp their investment situation more timely, accurately and completely, so that they can better optimize their fund portfolio allocation and better plan their financial arrangements.
如何注册使用？	How do I register to use it?
记者注意到，目前，“基金E账户”APP已在华为、苹果、小米、OPPO、vivo等手机应用商店上架，但APP尚处于公开试运行阶段，注册需要填写邀请码，投资者可以联系所持有基金的基金管理人获取。	The reporter noted that, at present, the "fund E account" APP has been in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and other cell phone application store shelves, but APP is still in the public trial stage, registration needs to fill in the invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the funds held to obtain.
上海一家中大型公募基金客服人员向经济观察网记者提供了一个6位数的邀请码，并告诉记者，“APP试运行阶段，中国结算提供给每个基金管理人一定数量的邀请码，投资者电话过来获取，我们都会提供。	A medium to large public fund customer service staff in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the Economic Observer reporter, and told the reporter, "APP trial run phase, China Settlement provides each fund manager a certain number of invitation codes, when investors call over to get, we will provide.
等试运行结束后，开放用户注册时就不用邀请码了。	After the trial run is over, the invitation code will not be used when opening user registration.
”	"
记者根据证监会官网公示的“基金E账户”下载及使用说明相关文件进行了账户注册并完成查询，整个过程耗时仅几分钟，主要分为四步：用户注册、实名认证、基金账户绑定、公募基金查询。	According to the official website of the Securities and Futures Commission, the reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry according to the documents related to the download and instruction of "fund E account", the whole process took only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
通过实名认证这一步之后，点击“资产”基金绑定按钮，记者通过各个基金销售平台购买的所有基金产品都呈现在绑定选项列表中（可绑定账户），完成绑定后就可以直观看到所投基金总资产并可以开始使用查询功能了。	After passing the real-name authentication step, click the "assets" fund binding button, and all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will be displayed in the binding option list (account binding is possible), and you can watch it directly after the binding is completed The total assets of the invested fund can be found and the query function can be used.
值得注意的是，“基金E账户”仅为投资者提供查询服务，并不能进行申赎买卖。	It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides querying services for investors and does not facilitate the buying or selling of funds.
“基金 E 账户”所显示的数据日期一般为用户进行查询的日期（T日)往前推三个交易日。	The data displayed on the "Fund E-account" is typically three trading days prior to the date (T-day) of the user's query.
比如，在2 月10日打开“基金E账户”，资产页所显示的总资产、基金份额、基金净值对应日期为该日期往前推三个交易日，即2月7日。	For example, if you open the "Fund E-account" on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and net asset values displayed on the asset page will correspond to the date three trading days prior to that date, which is February 7.

同抗中共 美日菲达成防卫共识	The US, Japan, and the Philippines reach a defense consensus against the CCP
亚洲 – 2月9日，菲律宾总统小马科斯（Bongbong Marcos）造访日本，与首相岸田文雄会谈。	"Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and held talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida."
双方就反对中共侵犯南海与东海达成共识，菲日领导人在会后发布共同声明表示，将通过和美国签署三边防卫协议，进行实质防务交流，反对中共霸权政策。	The two sides reached a consensus on opposing Chinese Communist aggression in the South and East China Seas, and the Philippine and Japanese leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting saying that they will conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to oppose Chinese Communist hegemonic policies.
根据日本媒体的说法，岸田文雄希望藉这次会晤帮助日菲两国建立针对台海危机的政策。	"According to Japanese media reports, Fumio Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies regarding the Taiwan Strait crisis."
小马科斯今年1月初曾访华，并且获得价值200亿美元的协议。	"Bongbong Marcos visited China in early January this year and obtained a deal worth 20 billion US dollars."
但在这之后，中菲关系不仅没好转，反倒下滑。	"However, after that, the relationship between China and the Philippines not only did not improve but instead deteriorated."
本月初，菲律宾与美国签署协议，同意对美军开放更多基地，保障南海安全。	"At the beginning of this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea."
新增加的一个基地距离台湾300公里，也是最接近中国的一个地点。	"The newly added base is located 300 kilometers away from Taiwan, and it is also the closest location to China."
如果台湾出现危机，美军可能会在菲律宾的基地发动行动。	"If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may potentially launch operations from bases in the Philippines."
日本媒体认为，现在日韩台澳乃至菲律宾都与美国形成轴心，构建西太平洋的“对抗中共弧线”，以推动地区合作。	"Japanese media believe that currently, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States, creating a 'curve of countering the Chinese Communist Party' in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation."
国民党副主席夏立言访中传达宋涛语：九二共识下欢迎绿营访陆	Kuomintang vice chairman Xia Liyan visit to convey Song Tao language: under the 1992 Consensus welcome the green camp to visit the mainland
台湾中国国民党副主席夏立言今次访中先后会见中国国台办主任宋涛与中共中央政治局常委王沪宁。	Xia Liyan, the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) from Taiwan, met with Song Tao, the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and Wang Huning, a member of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau, during his visit to China.
国民党官方机构国政基金会资深顾问赵春山昨天晚上接受台湾中央社采访，积极评价宋涛对夏立言所说，只要认同“九二共识”与反台独，中国欢迎绿营人士到访大陆。	In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Chiu Chun-shan, a senior advisor to the KMT's official National Government Foundation, commented positively on Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan that China welcomes green campers to visit the mainland as long as they agree with the "1992 Consensus" and oppose Taiwan independence.
国民党方面评价认为是新鲜事物。	The (KMT) considers this evaluation as a new development.
夏立言稍早会见宋涛当日新闻没有提及此说法。	Earlier, when Xia Liyan met with Song Tao, there was no mention of this statement in the news on the same day.
台湾执政的民进党连日澄清拒绝接受“九二共识”。	Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has for days clarified its refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus.
据中央社今天称，国民党副主席夏立言率团访陆，在北京期间，分别会见中共中央政治局常委王沪宁、新任国台办主任宋涛，与北京市委书记尹力。	According to the Central News Agency (CNA) today, KMT Vice Chairman Xia Liyan led a delegation to visit the mainland, and during his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new Director of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee.
夏立言与宋涛会面谈到国共的政治基础是“九二共识”与反台独，国民党国政基金会资深顾问赵春山则在会中表示，国民党的“九二共识”是原汁原味的“九二共识”。	The meeting between Xia Liyan and Song Tao talked about the political basis of the Communist Party is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, while Chiu Chun-shan, a senior advisor to the KMT National Government Foundation, said at the meeting that the KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".
赵春山分析，这与前几次参与的会议感受不同。	Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this meeting was different from previous ones in terms of the perceptions and experiences involved.
近期与大陆学界视讯座谈，以及这次的座谈，没有听到涉台学者讲武统与“反分裂法”，取而代之的是恢复交流与对话。	In recent video talks with mainland scholars, as well as this one, I did not hear Taiwan-related scholars speak of armed reunification and the "anti-secession law," but rather the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
赵春山指出，两岸兵凶战危，中国大陆盼能透过国民党转达改善关系的意向。	Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the two sides of the strait are fighting fiercely, and mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
因为民共之间没有互信，对方仍愿做好对台湾人工作，代表不希望两岸关系搞坏。	Due to the lack of mutual trust between the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Communist Party of China (CPC), Zhao Chunshan stated that the CPC still wishes to work for the benefit of the people of Taiwan, indicating that they do not want to worsen cross-strait relations.
据赵春山也说，王沪宁也亲自下指示向宋涛讲“他们（台湾农渔民）提的要求，你们一定要落实”，若无法通盘解决，也要采个案处理。	According to Zhao Chunshan also said that Wang Huning also personally gave instructions to Song Tao to say "they (Taiwan farmers and fishermen) put forward the request, you must implement", if the overall solution can not be adopted, but also to adopt a case-by-case approach.
该报道没有提及国民党人访大陆是否当面提及中国军机军舰每日扰台，台湾少数县市的农渔问题，以及中央社记者采访是否提问此类问题。	The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang members discussed the daily military provocations by Chinese aircraft and warships near Taiwan, the agricultural and fishing issues in certain counties and cities of Taiwan, or if these topics were raised by journalists from the Central News Agency during the interviews.
法工会再次动员反政府退休改革方案大游行	French trade unions mobilize again to protest against the government's retirement reform plan`1
周六(2月 11日 )，法国工会再次发起反对政府退休金改革草案全国动员，呼吁民众走上街头，表达意见。	On Saturday, February 11, the French labor unions launched another nationwide mobilization against the government's retirement pension reform draft, calling on the public to take to the streets and express their opinions.
这是这次反对政府退休金制度改革草案的社会风潮的第四个行动日。	This is the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government's retirement pension reform draft.
而有多少民众响应集会号召，可能影响工会团体下一步的行动方案。	The number of people responding to the call for the demonstration will likely influence the next steps of the trade union groups' action plan.
这是一个月以来，法国8大工会团体第四次共同发起全国动员，也是这次抗议活动首次将集会安排在周六。	This is the fourth time in a month that eight major French trade union groups have come together to launch a national mobilization, and the first time this protest has scheduled a rally on a Saturday.
鉴于对于大部分法国人来说，周六是公休日，他们不需要在是参加示威抗议活动，还是扣工资罢工之间做出选择，工会团体因此希望今天的集会活动能吸引更多人参与。	Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday and they don't have to choose between participating in a demonstration and protest or a wage garnishment strike, union groups are hoping that today's rally will attract more people.
公交系统地铁以及公营铁路公司的工会今天均未呼吁员工罢工，公交系统应该能正常运作，市民可以乘车前往集会地点，同时，在学校开始放冬假的地区，人们可以正常启程度假。	The unions of the public transportation system, the subway, and the public railroad companies are not calling for a strike today, the public transportation system should be able to operate normally and people can take the bus to the meeting place, while people can depart for their vacations normally in the areas where schools have started their winter vacations.
工会团体希望今天能有超过一百万人参加集会，而警方预期的全国参加人数可能在60万到80万之间，巴黎市区可能会集结9万到12万人。	Union groups are hoping for more than a million people to attend the rally today, while police expect the national turnout could be between 600,000 and 800,000, with 90,000 to 120,000 people likely to gather in downtown Paris.
自这次反政府退休金改革方案抗议行动开始以来，虽然民调显示，多数法国人不支持将法定退休年龄从目前的62岁推迟到64岁的措施，但真正走上街头参与游行的人数逐渐减少。	Since the beginning of this protest against the government's retirement reform plan, although opinion polls show that a majority of French people do not support the measure to raise the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets and participating in the demonstrations has gradually decreased.
1月31日的首次罢工示威活动在全国集结起127万到250万人。	The first strike demonstrations on January 31 rallied between 1.27 and 25 million people across the country
而本周二（2月7日）的示威人群已经缩水至全国75万7千人到两百万人之间。	The demonstration on this Tuesday, February 7, saw a decrease in the number of participants, ranging from 757,000 to 2 million people nationwide.
这项退休金改革方案目前正在法国国民议会讨论。	The retirement pension reform proposal is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
在野党，尤其是以激进左翼为首的在野党团递交了无数修正提案，以至于审议进程推动十分缓慢。	The opposition parties, especially the ones led by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendment proposals, which have slowed down the deliberation process significantly.
而朝野之间的争辩也日趋激烈尖锐。	The debates between the ruling party and the opposition have become increasingly fierce and contentious.
激进左翼政党法国不屈服党一名议员日前在社交媒体上传送自己脚踏一只印有劳动部长头像的气球的图片，引发执政党抗议。	A member of parliament from the radical left-wing party France Unbowed recently transmitted a picture of himself on social media with a balloon with the head of the labor minister on his foot, sparking protests from the ruling party.
国民议会议长最终宣布禁止这名议员参加议会活动15天，作为对这种行为的处罚。	The President of the National Assembly ultimately announced a 15-day suspension for the member of parliament, effectively barring them from participating in parliamentary activities, as a punishment for their conduct.
尽管这项改革方案引发了最近20多年来法国最大规模的社会风潮，但到目前为止，政府虽然对草案略有调整，但并没有做出任何重大让步。	Despite the widespread social unrest triggered by this reform proposal, which has been the largest in over two decades in France, the government has made only minor adjustments to the draft without making any significant concessions thus far.
工会已经准备在下周四也就是16日再次发起行动，3月7日，改革草案送交参议院讨论时，工会也计划组织示威行动。	The unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th, and are planning to organize demonstrations on March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion.

中国云南省人类精子库9日发出宣传，征求大专以上学历者或在校生捐精，成功捐赠8至12次可获人民币4500元补贴。	On the 9th, the Human Sperm Bank in Yunnan Province, China, issued a promotion seeking individuals with a college degree or above, or current students, to donate sperm. It stated that individuals who successfully donate sperm 8 to 12 times would receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan

据自由时报署名报道称，中国鼓励大学生捐精。	According to a report by Liberty Times, China is encouraging college students to donate sperm.
各地高校捐精其中北京捐精门槛最高，除学历外，也要求身高170公分以上、五官端正、无明显脱发、近视度数不能高于600度。	Various universities donate sperm among which Beijing donates sperm  with the highest threshold, in addition to academic qualification, theyalso requires a height of 170 cm or more, good facial features, no significant hair loss, and a degree of myopia  not  higher than 600 degrees.
据该报道称，云南省人类精子库指出，捐精者可获得价值1000人民币的全套男科体检，“尤其精液与染色体检测，大部分人从未做过，对了解自己的生育状态意义重大”。	“According to the report, the Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank noted that sperm donors receive a full set of male medical examinations worth 1,000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never had done before and are significant for understanding their fertility status."

东德最后一位共产党总理今去世	The last communist chancellor of East Germany died today
东德共产党的继任者在该党在一份声明中报告，“昨晚，汉斯·莫德罗 (Hans Modrow) 离开了我们，享年 95 岁。	The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95."
因此，我们的党失去了一位重要领导人。	Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
”	"
1989 年 11 月 13 日，在将东柏林和西柏林分开 28 年的柏林墙打开四天后，莫德罗曾表示他将帮助把东德变成一个民主国家。	On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had divided East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Hans Modrow expressed his commitment to helping transform East Germany into a democratic country.
当时，由于东德各地的抗议者要求民主和自由，共产党领导人被迫下台。	At that time, due to widespread protests demanding democracy and freedom across East Germany, Communist party leaders were forced to step down.
戈尔巴乔夫 (Mikhail Gorbachev) 在苏联上台后曾要求在苏联主导的东欧也进行变革。	After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for reforms in the Soviet-dominated countries of Eastern Europe as well.
1990 年 3 月，莫德罗宣布德意志民主共和国 (GDR) 的第一次也是唯一一次自由选举。	In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
选举结果导致他不再担任总理。	The election results led to him no longer serving as the Prime Minister.
尽管莫德罗进行了改革，但反对者指责他试图推迟 1990 年 10 月发生的政治变革和统一。	Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of attempting to delay the political changes and reunification scheduled for October 1990.
他还因试图重塑而不是废除秘密警察而受到批评。	He also faced criticism for attempting to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
1993 年，莫德罗在 1989 年 5 月的市政选举中被判选举舞弊罪名成立，但并未入狱。	In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to prison.
有称这些指控是出于政治动机。	There have been claims that these accusations were politically motivated.
1990 年至 1994 年，莫德罗继续在德国议会任职，并于 1999 年至 2004 年担任欧洲议会议员。	From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a Member of the European Parliament.
莫德罗将自己视为一名改革者，并希望从内部改变共产党。	Modrow considered himself as a reformer and aimed to bring about change within the Communist Party from within.
1999 年，他告诉路透社，他不希望旧东德回归，但表示应该承认东德的成就。	In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want a return to the old East Germany but believed that the achievements of East Germany should be acknowledged.
莫德罗于 1928 年出生在当时的德国小镇 Jasenitz（现为波兰的 Jasienica），并接受过机械师培训。	In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the old East Germany to return but said it should be recognized for its achievements.
第二次世界大战期间，他担任青年消防队排长，并在冲突快结束时成为纳粹民兵组织 Volkssturm 的一员，该组织征召 16 至 60 岁的男子参加最后的战争挣扎。	During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in the Youth Fire Brigade and, near the end of the conflict, became a member of the Nazi militia Volkssturm, which enlisted men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final struggle of the war.
17 岁时，莫德罗被苏联军队俘虏，作为战俘被带到苏联，在那里他参加了反法西斯课程，并成为一名坚定的共产党员。	At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a committed communist.
1949 年，即东德成立的那一年，他回国后找到了一份机械师的工作，并继续学习社会科学和经济学，并获得了博士学位。	In 1949, the year the GDR was founded, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic and continued his studies in social sciences and economics, earning a doctorate.
莫德罗是自由德国青年运动的一名工作人员，几乎所有东德年轻人都加入了该运动，并在 1973 年至 1989 年期间通过执政的社会统一党 (SED) 晋升为德累斯顿地区党的主席。	Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young East Germans joined, and rose through the ranks of the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) to become president of the Dresden Regional Party from 1973 to 1989.
他还在东德任职议会超过 30 年。	Indeed, Modrow served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
1990 年莫德罗成为东德事实上的领导人，担任最高国家职务。	In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, assuming the highest national position.

阿拉斯加上空被击落的 “物体”究竟是什么？	The "object" that was shot down over Alaska was what?
扑朔迷离，猜测纷纷	confused, speculative
美国军方周五（2月10日）下午再次动用美国最先进的隐身喷气战机F-22击落了一个在美国阿拉斯加上空飞行的尚未确定身份的物体。	On Friday afternoon (February 10) the US military once more brought down an unidentified flying object over Alaska using the F-22 its most sophisticated stealth fighter plane.
击落的地点距离阿拉斯加海岸十英里。	Ten miles off Alaska's coast, it was shot down.
这是美军在不到一周的时间里第二次击落空中飞行物体。	The American military has shot down an aerial object twice in less than a week.
上周六，来自中国的一个间谍气球在美国领空上漂移数日后在美国南卡罗莱纳州沿岸附近上空被击毁。	Last Saturday, a Chinese surveillance balloon that had been circling the US airspace for days was shot down close to the South Carolina coast.
五角大楼说，第二个被击落的物体于周四晚上首次进入美国领空，在阿拉斯加东北部上空移动时被美国军方跟踪，飞行高度为1.2万米（4万英尺），其大小与一辆小型汽车差不多，与先前被击落的那个中国间谍气球相比要小很多。	The second downed item first entered U.S airspace on Thursday night, was followed by American military personnel as it flew across northeast Alaska, at a height of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), according to the Pentagon, the Chinese surveillance balloon that was earlier shot down is considerably smaller than the automobile, which is around the same size.
五角大楼还认为，目前没有迹象显示，这个物体是可操纵的。	Additionally, according to the Pentagon, there is currently no proof that the item is manipulatable.
白宫国家安全委员会战略沟通协调员约翰·科比周五表示，虽然这个在高空飞行的物体的具体样子尚不清楚，但它“对民航飞机的安全构成了合理的威胁”。	Although the high-flying object's precise appearance remained unknown, according to White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby, it "posed a legitimate threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
科比表示，这个物体与美国境内发现的那个间谍气球不同，它上面没有悬挂“有效载荷”。	In contrast to the spy balloon discovered in the United States, the object, according to Bryant, did not have a "payload" suspended from it.
科比说，“我们把它称为一个‘物体’是我们目前能够作出的最好的描述”。	"The most accurate description we can currently provide is what we refer to as a 'object'," said Bryant.
拜登总统在下令击落这个物体之前听取了五角大楼的建议，他作出这个决定的时候“非常谨慎”，科比补充说。	Before deciding to send the object down, President Biden followed the Pentagon's counsel, a choice he made "very carefully," according to Bryant.
美国官方对这个物体的描述大致可以归纳为：大小相当于一辆小汽车，没有操纵杆，没有悬挂装置，飞行高度为一万米左右。	This object's official US description can be summed up roughly as follows: The flying height is around 10,000 meters, the size is comparable to a compact automobile, there is no joystick, and there is no suspension system.
但这些信息还无法回答基本问题，比如这个物体究竟是什么东西，它属于哪个国家，它在执行什么任务。	However, at this time, the information does not adequately address fundamental queries such what the object is, to which nation it belongs, and what function it serves.
目前网上许多的分析和猜测认为，这可能又是一只中国气球。	Many analyses and conjectures on the Internet at the moment suggest that this could be another Chinese balloon.
它可能与入侵美国领空的那只间谍气球和在拉美上空飘动的那只中国气球一样都来自中国，它们在不同地点执行某种任务。	It might have originated in China, just like the spy balloon that violated American airspace and the Chinese balloon that flew across Latin America and carried out some sort of operation elsewhere.
也有人把阿拉斯加的这个“物体”与“不明飞行物”（UFO）联系在一起。	This "object" in Alaska has also been linked by some individuals to a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).
美国新闻周刊的报道引用美国前众议员彼得·梅杰（Peter Meijer）周五在推特上发出的推文说，“真希望这个‘不明飞行物’也是一个间谍气球，而不是一个合法的UFO”。	Former US Representative Peter Meijer tweeted on Friday, "Wish this 'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO," according to a US Newsweek story.
“将外星飞船与气象气球混为一谈的讽刺意味很令人惊讶，但这不值得引发一场星际冲突，”梅杰说。	Major remarked, "although it would be ironic to mistake an extraterrestrial spacecraft for a weather balloon, it would not be worth starting an interstellar war."
梅杰是在科比证实阿拉斯加的这个物体被击落之后不久发出这个推文的。	The item in Alaska had been shot down, Bryant had just confirmed before Major's tweet.
新闻周刊说，怀疑这个物体是UFO的不止是梅杰一人。	According to Newsweek, Major was not the only person who thinks the object was a UFO.
田纳西共和党籍众议员蒂姆·伯切特（Tim Burchett）批评政府上个月的掩盖情报的做法，要求国家情报总监办公室 (DNI)公布有关“不明飞行物”的报告。	Rep Tim Burchett a Republican from Tennessee, condemned the administration's cover-up last month and demanded that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) disclose a report on "unidentified flying objects."
亚马逊的客服态度让我难以相信	I find Amazon's customer service attitude to be unbelievable
估计很少有人看到这里，但是我也要稍微说一下。	Although it is believed that few people would view this, I still want to add a little.
这件衣服当时我们购买的时候是一件拉链帽衫，最后送给我确是一件短袖。	When we purchased this dress, it had a zipper hood, but I ended up wearing a short-sleeved version.
收到衣服后立即与亚马逊客服取得了联系，当时确认衣服还是有库存的，我要求换货，客服说去解决一下，然后立即看到商品名称变成了短袖，原来我买的链接下架。	I immediately contacted Amazon customer support after getting the garments, it was determined at that time that there was still inventory of the clothing, I made a replacement request, after telling the customer care to fix it, they instantly saw that the product's name had been altered to short sleeves, it turned out that the link I purchased from had been withdrawn from the inventory.
接着客服通知要么保留货品补偿一定金额，要么退货。	The customer service then informed the consumer to either keep the items and get a specified amount of compensation, or return the things.
这就是亚马逊的处理方式？	Does Amazon handle it in this manner?
真的很难以置信，本身衣物发错并不是我的问题，作为一个消费者我要求获得我应获得的商品，并没有提出什么很夸张的要求，亚马逊却改名字，说无库存。	That wearing the wrong clothes is not a concern for me is very unbelievable, I make reasonable requests as a consumer and don't make any inflated demands,  Amazon claims it's out of stock and alters the name.
这是我的第一个长评，希望这不是我的最后一个。	My first lengthy review, which I hope won't be my last.
让人无法理解的袖子	The mysterious sleeve
说是牛皮的，也确实比较硬，但仔细看的话，局部有很多细小的裂痕，搞不清楚是否是真皮的，另外这个衣服的袖子真是让人无法理解，通常夹克的袖子要比衣摆长一些，不过通常也就1-2厘米，这件衣服足足长了5厘米，手臂自然下垂应该在手掌虎口的位置，但这件衣服的袖子都盖过手指了。	Although it is stated to be made of cowhide and is in fact fairly hard, if you look closely, you will notice that there are numerous tiny fractures in the surrounding area, making it unclear whether the leather is real, additionally, the sleeves on this garment are completely puzzling, the sleeves of coats are typically 1-2 centimeters longer than the hem of the clothing; however, the sleeves of this dress are a full 5 centimeters long, as a result, the arms should naturally hang down in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress cover the fingers.
买衣服容易，退货也容易。	Both clothing purchases, and returns are simple.
但是要退还钱真不知何时？	However, I am unsure of when I will receive my money returned?
衣服做工不错，因为版型偏小，只得退货，但是退了货以后，至今一个多星期过去了，还没有收到退款？	The garments are well-made, but I had to return them because the size was too small, more than a week has passed since I returned the items, but I still haven't received a reimbursement?
而且要购买者自已和那个诚信度不怎么样的全峰快递联系，这是自购亚马逊的物品以来最糟糕的一次购物！	Additionally the buyer must speak with the dishonest Quanfeng Express, the worst shopping experience since purchasing things from Amazon!
但店家还是不错的，积极配合催促快递及时退款，但是这个全峰快递实在的工作是做的相当让人愤怒，拖拉半个月左右才退款，这种合作伙伴是要拖亚马逊的后腿的，工作效率差，没有服务意识！	However, the store is still nice, actively helping to urge the express to refund promptly, however, Quanfeng Express' actual work is rather frustrating, and the reimbursement is delayed by approximately a month, such a partner would slow down Amazon, yes, ineffective work practices and a lack of service spirit!
更适合年轻人	Better suited to young individuals
99秒杀的。	the entire 99 seconds.
毛裤的做工、颜色、手感都不错，柔软/薄厚适中，没有煤油味儿。	The wool pants have good construction, a nice color, a decent amount of softness/thinness, and no kerosene odor.
遗憾的是版型属于瘦型的，更适合年轻人。	Sadly, the version is lacking in substance and would be better suited for young individuals.
3XL，平铺腰围2尺5，拉伸最大尺寸4尺，1.79/80公斤穿着腰有点紧。	The waist is a little snug in a 3XL, the flat measurement is 2 feet 5, the maximum stretch is 4 feet, and the weight is 1.79/80 kg.
似乎腰间没有松紧带，想加松点腰围还挺困难。	There doesn't appear to be an elastic band around the waist, and it is really challenging to make the waistline looser.
另外，贴身穿是不舒服的。	In addition, wearing it so close to your body is uncomfortable.
很好 颜色不是很鲜艳	Exceptionally good The color is not particularly vibrant
刚买就涨了两百多，这是什么情况。	What is happening, I just got it and it increased by more than two hundred.
第一次亚马逊用的合作的天天烂快递，第一次送货没在家，后来主动和快递员约了两次送货时间，那个快递员都不送，后来直接给我退货了，这个该死的快递员一点诚信也没有，强烈建议不要再用那个天天烂快递了。	Amazon had never before used the friendly Tiantianbai Express, the initial delivery wasn't to a residence, I later decided to take the initiative and schedule two delivery times with the courier, The package was returned to me immediately after the courier declined to deliver it, It is strongly advised not to utilize the courier any longer because they have no integrity at all.
这一次还有一件体恤衫也给我退货了，再拍也涨价了一百多元。	This time, I also exchanged a shirt, and when I re-auctioned it, the price went up by more than 100 yuan.
亚马逊自营不应该出现这样商品	Such products shouldn't appear in the Amazon self-service
产品特价的时候购买，价格不低，看评论也是很不错的产品。	After reading the reviews, I decided to get it when it was on sale even though the price is not cheap and the product is also quite good.
实际收到产品的时候让我目瞪口呆，商品表面大面积磨损，多处其他地方都有磨损，不是次品就是旧品，稍后上图。	I was shocked when I really received the thing, A sizable portion of the product's surface was worn, and there was wear in numerous other locations as well, Either the item was faulty or it was an outdated one, Later the image will be displayed.
我申请退货，厂家的人看到图片后说是运输导致，这不是瞎说吗？	I requested a return, and when the manufacturer's representatives saw the image they claimed that transportation was to blame, This is nonsense right?
商品内部怎么可能磨损？	How does anything get worn down inside?
只有两种可能，要么次品旧品，要么就是我故意损坏商品，然后拿去退货。	There are only two possibilities: either the merchandise is faulty, or I purposely harmed the item before returning it.
客观来讲，我没有证据证明我没有损坏商品，但是以我在亚马逊购物的信用记录来讲，我认为这样的商品不应该出现在亚马逊自营商品中，客户选择亚马逊自营就是信任，customer win，we win，客户的胜利就是厂商的胜利，希望大家一起努力改进，谢谢。	Objectively speaking, I have no proof that I did not damage the item, but considering my track record of Amazon purchases, I believe that such items shouldn't be included in Amazon's self-operated products, Customers choose to trust Amazon's self-operated products, customer win, we win, I hope everyone will work hard to improve, thank you.
我使用该产品不到一年，就出现两个E2，我不知道如何处理?	There are two E2s, and I've just been using this product for a little over a year, I'm not sure how to handle it?
我是2015年7月30日购买该商品的，但在2016年3月份接收器右边两组就经常出现红色E2，应是发射模块出现问题吧，这与亚马逊网站上讲的发射模块可持续工作7年不大相符吧，在亚马逊网站上又找不到售后，现不知如何是好?	I purchased this item on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, red E2 started to show on the two groups on the receiver's right side, the transmitter module ought to be the source of the issue, this is consistent with the transmitter module's ongoing operation, as was noted on the Amazon website, I don't know what to do now because 7 years doesn't quite match and I can't find after-sales support on the Amazon website?
还行吧	Not bad at all
第一次购买是坏的。	The initial buy wasn't good.
感觉不像新的。	It doesn't seem brand-new.
盒子上的标签被撕了，机身上标签也破了。	Both the label on the fuselage and the label on the box were torn.
而且老是白屏。	And the screen is always white.
换了以后好了。	Once changed, everything will be fine.
换货挺迅速，晚上有点模糊，视角不是很广，但是普通家用够了。	Although the viewing angle is not very wide, the replacement is extremely quick, and it is a little hazy at night; it is sufficient for everyday home use.
不足就是没有卡，自己买的，还有就是以前在亚马逊买过手机。	The drawback is that there is no card; I paid for it out of pocket and previously purchased a phone from Amazon.
包装上会有贴纸，防止包装被打开，这次没有，买手机时候还有个贴纸一样的章，可以贴在保修卡上，这次没有。	To prevent the package from being opened, there will be a sticker on it, No not now, there is a sticker that resembles a chapter that may be placed to the warranty card when purchasing a mobile phone, No not now.
不知道是不是东西便宜了就没有，很困惑。	I'm perplexed, I'm not sure if it's because products are so inexpensive.
等待供货商回复	Awaiting response from the supplier
包装没有任何标识，直接给供货商致电说，回答没标识是正品，如怀疑可用边角料邮寄到强生公司验货，还留下车牌号以及电话号码，承诺会发短信通知把我的信息输入强生官网保修卡，到现在也没收到短信啊？	Since there is no mark on the package, I called the supplier directly to ask about the matter and was told that the good is authentic despite the lack of a mark, If there is any dispute, I may submit it to Johnson & Johnson for review and include the phone number and license plate information, I swear to tell Johnson & Johnson of my information by text message, Why has a text message not yet been sent to the warranty card on the official website?
上午收到机油，下午就换上了。	Changed the oil in the afternoon, after receiving it in the morning.
第二次购买。	Second acquisition.
亚马逊自营商品还是很放心的。	Self-operated Amazon goods continue to be quite comforting.
换油的师傅说油品清亮，确实是好油 。	The oil was changed by the master, who claimed that it was clean and good oil.
因为是第二次购买了。	Since this is a second purchase.
所以还是很放心的。	I'm still incredibly relieved as a result.
快递飞速，包装没有挑剔的地方，用了这个油，发动机声音明显下降。	Express shipping is quick, and packing requirements are flexible, the engine noise has greatly decreased after using this oil.
性价比不错，二百以下很难找到合成机油。	The price-to-performance ratio is favorable, and finding synthetic motor oil for under 200 is challenging.
支持星冠，支持胜牌，对车有效保护。	Support the winning card, the star crown, and successfully defend the vehicle.
日本亚马逊因为客服问题导致买家的利益严重受损（8c的毛毛虫发货为8cm的毛毛虫）（8c=14cm，8cm=2c）	Due to customer service issues (8c caterpillars are supplied as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c), Amazon Japan has significantly harmed the interests of buyers
承认错误，但是一直在推诿，始终强调货物为第三方，不能约束第三方。	Acknowledging errors but consistently denying and highlighting the fact that the items belong to a third party and cannot be restrained.
订单编号：503-4265464-1830254。	Number of the order: 503-4265464-1830254.
我当初购买的页面尺码选项为7c，8，9c，当时觉得这就是个陷阱，打电话给日亚中文客服，明确告知8就是8c，但是等商品回到中国才发现，只有8cm，我觉得这完全是故意设下的陷阱来坑中国人（按照亚马逊的售后），现在查看页面已没有这个选项。	I first purchased the 7c, 8, and 9c page size options, I initially believed this to be a trap, I informed Nichia's Chinese customer care that 8 was 8c, However, after the item was sent back to China, I learned that it was actually just 8 cm, according to Amazon's after-sales support, it is a full trap that was set up specifically to catch Chinese people, and as of right now, no such choice is available on the viewing page.
中方客服：很抱歉，给你带来损失了，我们给你两条路走：	Customer service in Chinese: We apologize for your loss and offer two solutions:
1，你退货，买家承担所有运费。	1, You return the merchandise, and the buyer is responsible for all shipping charges.
2，你不退货，我们补偿你1000日元。	2, We will give you a reward of 1,000 yen if you do not return the goods.
（我算一下账，鞋子4000多日元，算作200rmb，选择1，我没有鞋子，损失在200元。	(I'll calculate it for you: the shoes cost more than 4,000 yen, which is equivalent to 200 rmb; pick 1, I don't have shoes; the loss is 200 yuan.
选择2，我有鞋子，最后补偿了我2000日元，最后损失在150rmb 客服：我们已记录下来，我们会认真处理，次日回了封邮件，说我不接受中方客服调解，就这么完了。	Option 2, I have shoes, and they finally gave me 2,000 yen in compensation; my final loss was 150 rmb, Customer service: We have it on file and will treat it with care, the following day, I replied to an email and ended the conversation by stating that I would not accept the Chinese customer service's mode of resolution.
我提出：购买的页面为7c，8，9c这样具有迷惑性的选项时，中方客服帮我说起了日本常用码是不会带c这样的，类似140这样的，但是你们特么有去其他毛毛虫页面看吗？	I suggested: Have you folks gone to see the caterpillar page where the buy page contains perplexing possibilities like 7c, 8, and 9c, and Chinese customer support helped me inform you that Japanese common codes do not include c, similar to 140?
都有美码，日码混标的情况出现。	Both have a mixed label scenario with American and Japanese codes.
再说，你8cm为什么放在7c和9c中间，明明最小的尺码，你放那里算什么意思。	In addition, why do you place 8 cm between 7 cm and 9 cm when it is definitely the smallest size.
中方客服：我们提供中文服务，但是不知道你要运回国，所以你的运费我们是不予理赔的。	Chinese customer service: We offer Chinese service, but since we are unsure whether you'll be sending it back to your own nation, we are unable to cover your shipping expenses.
这个逻辑我又不懂了，我是日本人，我还要中文客服，生活在日本的中国也不需要中文客服，去日本游客，没有那个功夫打国际长途，那么问题来了，什么人需要打亚马逊海外购中文电话，无非像我这样日淘的。	This reasoning baffles me once more, I need Chinese customer service despite being Japanese, Customer service from Chinese speakers in Japan is unnecessary, the ability to place international long-distance calls is not a talent that visitors to Japan possess, who needs to call, This then becomes a question, nothing more than regular purchasing for me, Amazon is buying Chinese phones from other countries.
亚马逊中文客服不就是方便了我们海淘的这些人吗？	Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service simply more practical for those of us who shop from abroad?
这次购买不是很满意	This acquisition falls short of expectations
这是第二次从亚马逊上购买帮宝适尿布，曾经在宝宝2个月的时候买过一箱，选择了欧洲进口纸张的尿布，第一次购买经历还是比较满意的，宝宝整夜就用一张尿布，的确可以满足12个小时不换尿布。	I've purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon twice already, my baby was 2 months old when I purchased a box of diapers, I decided on diapers made of imported European paper, I was happy with my first buy in general, All night, the infant used them, without changing diapers, one diaper can last 12 hours.
但是这次购买L号的尿布，一箱里面有2包分开包装，打开后就觉得纸张比较松，跟进口帮宝适有明显区别，给宝宝用了之后，还算可以，没有漏尿也没有红疹等迹象。	However, I purchased L-size diapers this time, 2 packs, each packed separately, are contained in a box, When I opened it, the paper felt loose, which is certainly not the case with imported Pampers, red rash and further symptoms.
但是到了第二包尿布，开始使用后宝宝的大腿内侧立马就出现了红疹，至今还没有褪去。	But after using the second pack of diapers, the infant developed a rash on the inside of his thighs that hasn't yet disappeared.
怀疑1箱里面的2包，质量还不一样啊。	The 2 products in 1 box might not be of the same quality, in my opinion.
以后应该不会继续购买了！	Should not make further purchases in the future!
希望重视包裹的运输保护	Hope to be mindful of package shipment protection
这是我网购这么久以来，看到最差的一次包装运输，完全没有什么保护措施，缓冲泡沫，包裹缓冲层材料等，什么都没有。	Since I've been doing a lot of internet shopping, this is the worst wrapping and shipping I've ever encountered, there are absolutely no protective measures, such as cushioning foam, wrapping materials, or cushioning layer materials, etc, nothing at all.
就一个压变形的箱子。	Just a box that is crumpled and distorted.
而且里面的软胶盒包装的，卡盒都压开了压到变形了。	Additionally, the card box had been forced open and twisted, and the soft plastic box within had been packed.
希望是正品 质量有保证，以后是不怎么敢亚马孙买东西的了。	I'm hoping it's real and of guaranteed quality, In the future, I won't have the guts to order anything from Amazon.
宁愿国内贵一半，有保障点。	I'd rather pay half as much in China and get a warranty.
而且商品产品包装问题，我看评论2016年就有人评论过，到现在19年，还是老样子。	And the issue with product packaging hasn't changed in 19 years, according to comments I read in 2016, Someone left a comment about it.
说明亚马逊根本就不重视服务反馈这一块，和国内的京东、天猫等差太远了。	It demonstrates how poorly Amazon responds to customer complaints and how far behind domestic rivals JD dot com and Tmall it is.
好看，但有点点小遗憾	It's encouraging to see, although there is some disappointment
整个杯子的颜色是我狠喜欢的，橘红色，虽然我家是男宝，但是还是觉得橘红配黄色很亮眼。	The color of the entire cup is my favorite, orange red, and even though my family is all boys, I believe orange red and yellow are extremely appealing.
比我想象的小一些，不过本来就是拿来带出门用的，所以还可以接受。	It's smaller than I expected, but it's designed to be removed, so it's fine.
昨晚拿回家试了一下，瓶盖推开之后，吸管和盖子之间的距离太近了，因为吸管的位置是正向垂直的，所以儿子总是要把盖子上面的凸起含住喝水，觉得这个地方是否可以改进一下。	I brought it home and gave it a shot last night, the space between the straw and the bottle cap was too close when the bottle cap was pushed off, because the straw is vertical, my son had to catch the bump on the top to sip water, I believe this location can be enhanced.
看来其他牌子的吸管杯把吸管做的倾斜还是有道理的，小孩子的东西，真的就是在乎安全和舒适。	Other manufacturers of straw cups appear to tilt the straw, which makes sense, children's items are very concerned with safety and comfort.
轻便大容量	Lightweight and huge capacity
喜欢它轻便，开口大，就是两个独立的分隔袋对我来说有点多余，感觉不知道装什么好。	I like how light it is, and how spacious the entrance is, but two distinct compartments are a bit unnecessary for me, and I'm not sure what to put into it.
买完发现海外购美亚上还有一只另一个牌子很类似的，才不到两百块。	After purchasing it, I discovered that another brand that is nearly identical is available on Overseas Buy Meiya for less than 200 yuan.
假货，假的特别厉害	Counterfeit, counterfeit is quite powerful
亚马逊卖假货，我也是服了。	Amazon sells counterfeit goods, and I'm confident of it.
客服说因为用了所以不能退货，我没用怎么知道是假货。	The goods cannot be returned, according to customer service, because it has been used. How can I tell it's a fake if it's not used?
因为信任，所以伤心，毕竟是抹脸的用品，真的去实体店买吧，认可贵一点。	I am unhappy because of trust, after all, it is a face-wiping product, you should purchase it in a physical store, it is acknowledged that it is more costly.
因为是秒杀，所以没有看评论，我已经提交国家工商总局的电商平台了，我们一起维权吧。	Because it is a surge, I did not read the comments, I've submitted it to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform, let us all work together to protect our rights.
坏了？	Is it damaged?
假货？	Counterfeit goods?
总之悲剧。	Simply put, tragedy.
用第二片的时候选的毛孔细致的，但是一打开就一股怪味，以为是正常的，因为没用过这款，然后往脸上贴的时候就整个受不了了，非常冲的味道，无法形容，熏到立马咳嗽了出来，眼睛也很痛，流眼泪，马上摘了去洗脸。	The pores on the second piece were fine when I used it, but there was an odd smell when I opened it, I hadn't used this one before, so I assumed it was typical, but when I placed it on my face, I couldn't tolerate it, it has a strong fragrance, I pulled it off right away to wash my face since it is so unbelievable smokey that I immediately coughed out, my eyes stung, and tears started to pour.
不信邪又开了一片同款的，没有那么重的味道了，现在正在敷。	Another slice of the same kind, which doesn't have a strong smell and is currently being applied, was opened by Buxinxie.
回想起有点像发廊里劣质烫发水的味道。	Now that I think about it, the hair salon kind of smells like terrible perm water.
真无法想象，难倒亚马逊自营的护肤品从此也得避而远之了吗？	I can't fathom, is it really that tough to stop using Amazon's self-operated skin care items going forward?
奸商啊	Untrustworthy businessman ah
当时购买的时候，活动页面上是说满99元赠送“三体全集”，收到货没有这个赠品，打客服电话说要给他们看当时活动的截图，问题是谁买东西还把网页截图保存啊，你们自己做过的活动，还需要顾客帮你们提供啊，各位买家下次要留个心眼，保存证据。	The event page stated that after I spent 99 yuan on it, I would give away the "Complete Works of Three-Body Problem", I didn't have this present when I got the products, when I called customer service, I promised to present the screenshots of the occurrence at hand, who purchased the items and took the website screenshots is the subject of the query, ah you see, you need consumers to give you the services you have performed for yourself, buyers should be cautious the next time and save the proof.
用后感受	Feelings following use
第一次在亚马逊买东西，分别感受有几点，先来说下用完商品的感受吧，第一确实是无痛，也没有刺激味道的东西，总体来说很不错的，静等8分钟左右一擦就掉了，只是会有少量的汗毛渣在上面，不细看是看不出来的，所以说总体是不错的，至于之后都就用一次还要继续观察，继续用才会知道。	I made my first Amazon purchase with this one, I have some relevant experience, first, let me discuss how it feels to finish a product, the first benefit is that it has no unpleasant taste or sensation, Overall, it's excellent, observe for 8 minutes, overall, it is good because after using it once, you need to continue observing, and you will know if you continue to use it, wipe it left and right and it will come off, but there will be a small amount of hair residue on it, which cannot be seen until you look closely.
反正我觉得这个东西确实不错。	Whatever the case, I think this is a really great thing.
第二从27号下单，12号收到货，总共15天也就是半个月，亚马逊的送货员服务态度也很好。	The second thing is placing an order on the 27th and receiving the items on the 12th, a total of 15 days, or half a month, the delivery team at Amazon also has a very good customer service attitude.
第三，亚马逊的什么黑色星期五就不要相信了，星期五下单，等了2天就便宜了接近12块钱，也就是我买成170多（加上运费什么的），有一种搞活动就提价格的感觉样。	Third, disregard Amazon's Black Friday, the price drops by around 12 yuan if you order on Friday and wait 2 days, thus I paid more than 170 (plus shipping), prices seem reasonable.
客服说什么价格波动，我关注了10多天价格也就是这个样，波动也不大的。	According to the customer service, the pricing changes, I've been keeping track of the pricing for more than 10 days, and it remains this way with only a small amount of variation.
价格实惠，日原产，有中文标签，带颗粒，绝对回购！	Affordable pricing, Chinese name, produced in Japan, with granules, would definitely buy again!
膏体里带颗粒的，清爽感恰到好处，用后牙齿爽滑，上比某二手东强太多啦，那里说是进口的东西，可好多东西没有中文标签，不知从哪里批发的。	The paste has granules, feels perfectly refreshing, and leaves teeth with a smooth finish after usage, it is superior to a used item by a wide margin, although it claims to be imported, several items lack Chinese labelling, I don't know where they are purchased in wholesale.
以后只要亚马逊有的，绝不再去二手东。	I won't ever shop at second-hand stores again, as long as Amazon has it.
给个建议，亚马逊的app 上晒单怎么有时晒不了，希望能改进一些应用，会做的越来越好的！	Please make a suggestion, as to why the listing on the Amazon app occasionally cannot be submitted, as I would like to enhance some apps, so that they perform better and better!
卓越这些年，越来越差，根本没有服务质量可言！	Over the years, Excellence has deteriorated to the point where there is no quality of service to speak of!
垃圾卓越不顾及客户需求 下订单的时候特别配送时间19:00-22:00。	Garbage Excellence does not regard the demands of the consumer, when placing an order, please specify the specific delivery time of 19:00-22:00.
因家里有术后卧床不方便的老人在，所以只有晚上可以方便收件。	Mail delivery is only practical at night since some elderly individuals find it uncomfortable to stay in bed after surgery.
结果竟然中午12点就直接上门送了，也不事先电话告知。	Surprisingly, the outcome is delivered without prior telephone communication at 12:00 noon, immediately to the door.
如果配送时间是你们快递员随心所欲的想几点就几点送，何必假惺惺弄个时间让客户选择？	Why bother making a time for the consumer to choose if the delivery time is that your courier may deliver it whenever he wants?
如果自己的物流没办法保证服务的，那就干脆不要做电商了！	Don't undertake any e-commerce if your own logistics can't ensure the service!

不会再在卓越上花一毛钱。	No more money will be spent on Excellence.
图片质量实在不能接受	The visual quality is quite poor
作为“古地图集”这样的标题，本书在图片的选择、排版、印刷上实在令人难以接受，有些图片甚至有马赛克，模糊到无法辨识。	The photo selection, formatting, and printing in this book are truly awful given the title "Ancient Atlas", Some images even contain mosaics, but they are so blurry that it is impossible to tell what they are.
即便本书不是专业的地图册，即便是小画幅插图，也应该对得起目录中祖先留下来的洋洋大观的中古文献资料！	The exquisite medieval manuscripts left by the ancestors in the catalog should be worthy of this book, even though it is not a professional atlas and only a small-format image!
（况且很多图片是可以从相关行业资源中获取清晰的原始文件的），用这样的图片来拼凑图书与不使用图片有何差别？	(In addition, numerous images can be acquired from sources relevant to the industry in clean original formats), what distinguishes the use of such images in book construction from the absence of images?
！我为这样的治学精神感到遗憾。	！ Such a scholastic spirit makes me feel sad.
文字方面不予评价，方家各有分辨。	There is no commentary on the text, because every family is unique.
整体2星。	2 stars altogether.
高二的时候看的这本书当时只是抱着无聊看看玩的心态，感觉这样的书自己应该不会沉迷吧，毕竟起点的网文以往还是不太吸引我的。	In my sophomore year of high school, I read this novel, to pass the time, I read and played games, I believe that I shouldn't be so dependent on a book, after all, I had previously found Qidian's web articles to be somewhat unappealing.
然后...就掉坑里了。	Subsequently...it fell into the pit.
按着这个剧情来说，整本书都是比较轻松愉快的，前部分叶修还在网游里的时候，即使是公会之间勾心斗角，也因为往往被叶神狗血，搞得一点也不沉重。	This premise makes it seem like the entire book is rather carefree and joyful, because of Ye Xiu's blood in the first half, while Ye Xiu was still playing the online game, even the guild intrigue was not overly intense.
至于到了比赛的部分，写出了时代的变迁新旧交替的一点点心酸之感（可能是我多愁善感）。	Regarding the competition portion, I wrote about the passage of time and the juxtaposition of the old and modern with a hint of melancholy (maybe I am sentimental).
看整部书花了我高二许多学习时间，可是就是停不下来。	I read the entire book in my second year of high school, which required a lot of study time, but I couldn't put it down.
全职对人物和感情线的描写让人十分惊艳，有的人物只是偶尔带过，也会给人留下很深的影响，像比较重点描写的角色叶修黄少天苏沐橙都有大量的粉丝，而不在写作中心的角色例如江波涛楚云秀等等也十分找人喜欢，在一个电竞的爽文中竟然让人找不到一个让人讨厌至极的人物，这是全职在人物描写上的成功。	The character and emotional lines described in Full-time are truly wonderful, Some characters, who are only sporadically introduced, have a profound effect on the audience, for instance, Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng have a lot of followers since they are more concentrated characters, even the characters that are not part of the writing core, such Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu, are endearing, nobody can discover a particularly grating character in a cool piece on e-sports, this character description is a complete success.
而在感情线上，全职也没有一般网文所令人诟病的后宫佳丽三千万要么美女要么腐的毛病，全文所有人的感情，都有一个共同的地方就是他们喜欢着荣耀这个游戏，并且大都想要堂堂正正的胜利。	Regarding the emotional line, there aren't any of the 30 million harem beauties who are decried in common web publications, either they are gorgeous or they are evil, everyone's feelings are expressed in the complete language, and they all share the desire to triumph honorably and enjoy the game of glory.
小计量有却没有什么大阴谋，每个人看上去都那么单纯可爱。	Everyone seems so innocent and adorable, and there are just little conspiracies.
这或许也是为什么全职没有什么令人讨厌的角色。	There might not be any unpleasant full-time jobs for this reason.
全职的IP很大，也归功于此。	This is due in large part to full-time IPs.
撇开网文这个文化现象不谈，全职不失为一本不错的书。	Full-time is still a terrific book even when the cultural phenomena of internet writing is disregarded.
多少他真的会给人提供一些热血，一点点感动。	He will essentially give a tiny touch and some hot blood.
今年4月份全职要动漫化。	In April of this year, animation will be full-time.
其实想要买齐这套书很久了，碍于永远钱包不够厚都没狠下心下手，然后想要买的时候就发现，tb上简直是假货猖獗，其实全职最近出了另一个版本，封面图吧我自己是蛮喜欢的，但还是打算先买老的版本，所以就在亚马逊上看了看，一次性买下来了一套。	In fact, I've wanted to acquire this collection of books for a while, but I've put it off since my wallet isn't thick enough, then, when I went to purchase it, I discovered that there were many fakes on tb, in truth, the cover image was just released in a different version by the full-time, I visited Amazon and ordered a set all at once because I personally really enjoy it but still intend to purchase the older version first.
接下来简单说一下货的情况。	Let's now briefly discuss the state of the products.
●第四本的塑封没有，但书是新的。	●The fourth book doesn't have a plastic cover, but it is brand-new.
●第十七本塑封是在但是被打开了，书的质感也很奇怪感觉没有其他的硬。	●The seventeenth book is still in its plastic packaging, but it has been opened, its texture is also quite odd, and it is not as hard as the others.
●第23本和第十七本情况一样，但是也比第十七本硬，但十分的旧。	●The 23rd book is identical to the 17th book, however, it is older and harsher than the 17th book.
●个别几本书的出版社不同好像第23和17就是同一个出版社，和其他的不同。	●Individual novels are published by various companies, in contrast to the others, it appears that the 23rd and 17th are published by the same company.
●整体来讲还算满意，24本很大一箱，很满足。	●Overall, I'm happy with the outcome, a sizable box contains 24 books, and I am pleased with my purchase.
落寞的小狮子	The abandoned lion cub
拿到书的时候，以为会像是《失落的一角》那么简单，结果文字还很多哎！	I assumed the book would be as straightforward as "The Lost Corner" when I first acquired it, but there are actually a lot of words!
先后念了三次，才给小朋友念完这本书，一只会开枪的小狮子，爱吃果汁软糖的小狮子。	I had to read this book to the kids three times before I was done, A small lion that is proficient with a firearm, a small lion who adores marshmallows.
当看到狮子吃掉猎人这个情节的时候，心里略有不适，现代都市人对于被动物吃掉这样的安排有点接受不了。	I was a little uneasy when I saw the plot about the lion eating the hunter, Animals eating humans is an arrangement that modern urbanites cannot support.
看到最后，这个在人类社会成功了的小狮子，迷失了自己，他已经不是完全的狮子，也不是完全的人。	This tiny lion who thrived in human civilization ultimately lost himself, Both a whole lion and a full man, he is no longer.
最后，只有小狮子的背影，不知道他去哪儿了。	In the end, all that was left was the small lion's back, and I have no idea what happened to him.
可能多年以后，这个小狮子的形象还留在长大了的小朋友的印象中，在某一天不经意的时候被想起，或许对她会有触动或是启发。	Maybe the grown-up kids will still remember this small lion years from now, and if she is unintentionally reminded of it one day, it might move or inspire her.
性价比很高的作品集	Portfolio that is economical
1、以前还不知道TASCHEN，最近买了不少他们的书，原因就是太强悍，不论是选题还是制作本身。	1, I wasn't familiar with TASCHEN previously, but recently I bought a lot of their books, This is because they are simply too effective, whether it's the choice of topics or the quality of the production.
本作先后出过3个版本，最大的版本和那本米开朗基罗全集一样，都是接近50厘米长34厘米宽的；中版本大概是36厘米长23厘米宽；而这版是最小，而且配有书盒的两册书版。	This piece of work has undergone 3 revisions, The three sizes are: the largest, which is roughly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, the medium, which is roughly 36 cm long and 23 cm wide, and the smallest, which is this version, A book box for two volumes is also included.
个人觉得还可以接受，一来价格便宜，且700多页分成两本，作为平装本也较好翻阅；二来是不同于米开朗基罗全集那本，画作占了主体，达芬奇这本黑白手稿占了大部分，对于预算有限的、非美术专业读者而言，这版作为欣赏画作和手稿的性价比是最高的。	Personally, I believe it to be appropriate, First off, it's inexpensive, and it comes in two paperback volumes with a combined total of more than 700 pages, It differs from Michelangelo's full works, which are primarily made up of paintings, in two ways, the majority of Da Vinci's manuscripts are in black and white, this edition is the most affordable for readers with tight budgets and non-art majors to appreciate paintings and writings.
2、绘画部分的解说很棒，有构图分析、草稿分析和历史背景（比如最后的晚餐），但不知道是印刷还是书尺寸问题，有些阴影部分县的太深了，看不清细节，有点遗憾。	2, The painting section explanation is excellent, including composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical context (such as the Last Supper), but I'm not sure if it's the printing or the book's size, The details cannot be properly seen because of certain too-dark shadows, pity.
3、对比米开朗基罗的手稿，达芬奇的手稿内容就丰富的多。	3, The manuscripts of Da Vinci include a lot more information than those by Michelangelo.
前者已经是天才了，后者涉猎之广、成就之高，不足以天才来形容。	The former is already a genius, whereas the latter's body of work and accomplishments are insufficient to qualify them as geniuses.
如果以前只看画作只能体会一半的达芬奇，看完手稿就彻底没语言了。	You will be rendered absolutely dumbfounded after reading the manuscripts if you could only comprehend half of Da Vinci from the artwork before.
垃圾，谁买谁后悔！	Whoever purchases it will regret it, it is garbage!
从来不给差评的，这个真心垃圾，买了浪费钱 神马，给个理由！	I seldom leave negative reviews, but this is truly awful and buying it is a waste of money, God horse, please tell me why!
1.走时不准，突然变成1月1号，时间归零了。	1. The journey time is incorrect; then, all of a sudden, it is January 1st, and the time resets to zero.
2.劣质皮带，都不是硅胶的，带了手腕过敏起泡。	2. Subpar belts are not silicone-made, and blisters on the wrists cause an allergic reaction.
3.经常连不上手机。	3. Frequently unable to connect to a mobile phone.
4.续航只有五天。	4. There is only a five-day battery life.
5.睡眠检测不显示，时间是0。	5. The time is 0 and there is no indication of sleep detection.
6.不防水。	6. Not water-resistant.
7.其他。	7. Others.
物流太慢	A slow logistics system
显示10月16号到，结果21号才收到，差评！	Although it appears to have arrived on October 16, it was actually just received on October 21, Poor reviews!
快递太差，亚马逊上买东西本来就慢，没想到会这么慢！	That delivery is awful, I didn't anticipate Amazon shopping to be this slow, but it is already slow!
总体满意	Overall fulfillment
之前一开始还担心相机的包装，这次还好，里面有充气包，相机三码一致，也能在官网注册，快门次数0，其余的就只能等时间检验了 。	Initially, I was concerned about the camera's packaging, but this time everything was fine, the camera comes with an inflatable bag, it comes in the same three sizes, it can be registered on the official website, the number of shutter times is 0, and the remaining features can only be tested over time.
发货速度还蛮快的，在这里吐槽一下快递小哥，贵重的物品就放在门房，走的飞快，我没办法当着他面开箱检验，对这点实在是无语。	The delivery pace is really quick, I want to voice my displeasure with the messenger here, the items are left with the concierge, and disappear quickly, in front of him, I am unable to inspect the package, I'm completely at a loss for words.
商家发货前做到了为客户着想:)	Prior to delivery, the retailer did it for the benefit of the customers:)
商家比较负责，专门打电话问所用相机的屏幕尺寸，确实替客户着想了。	The retailer is acting more responsibly by contacting especially to inquire about the camera's screen size, which is done for the customer's benefit.
发货速度也快。	Additionally, shipping happens quickly.
金刚膜贴上去也挺合适和管用的。	The Diamond film is also very appropriate and effective.
电池充不满	Uncharged battery
机器确实不错，想问下怎么第一次充电起就充不满啊，充电指示灯一直红色	The equipment is excellent, why is it not fully charged after the initial charge, and why is the charging indication continually red?
目前找不到亚马逊官方反馈渠道，所以只能在商品评价里反馈	I am limited to providing comments in product reviews because there isn't currently an official Amazon feedback route
1. 在 3 月 29 号，通过预购途径使用 31 元购买了此书，显示 3 月 31 号会推送到设备上，此时亚马逊官网上还无法预览该书（因为还未发布）；	1. I bought the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel on March 29, and it says it would be delivered to my device on March 31, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website at this moment (since it has not yet been released);
2. 3 月 31 号推送到设备上的书，内容是空白，只有敬请期待，而亚马逊上该书电子版降价到了 18 元；	2. The price of the book's electronic version on Amazon has been lowered to 18 yuan, and the content of the book that was pushed to the device on March 31 is blank;
3. 这两天反复尝试将设备上的下载的空白的书进行删除，再次同步，都无法获取到包含实际内容的电子版《商业的本质》，但是看到亚马逊官网已经可以预览该书。	3. I have tried several times over the past two days to remove the downloaded blank book from the device and synchronize it again, but I am unable to download "The Essence of Business" in its entirety, however, I can see that the book can be previewed on Amazon's official website.
目前我有几点感想	So far, I have a few ideas
1. 价格的问题其实并不是最重要的，关键是现在怎么将kindle上空白的书换成有实际内容的书，而不是永远下载下来都是“敬请期待”	1. The price issue is not the most crucial one, the trick is to figure out how to swap out the empty books on Kindle with books that have actual substance rather than just downloading them indefinitely and saying "stay tuned"
2. 预购的书以后应该不会再买了，毕竟万一跳票，再下载一本空内容的书，手续看起来非常复杂；	2. The book that was preordered shouldn't be purchased again in the future, after all, the process appears to be exceedingly difficult if the ticket is bypassed, followed by the download of a book with no content;
3. 希望亚马逊给到一个可以反馈此类问题的正常渠道，当对电子书下载、或者使用提出疑义的时候可以有地方反馈（工单、线上客服都可以，可以参考微软官方商城是怎么做的）	3. I'm hoping that Amazon will make a regular channel available for input on these problems, there will be a place to provide feedback when there are questions concerning the download or use of e-books (you can refer to Microsoft's official mall for instructions on how to do so through work orders or online customer care, both of which are appropriate)
不是很推荐阅读	Reading is not highly advised
很久前读的，恰巧看见了凭记忆写点读后感吧。	I happened to notice it because I read about it a long time ago, so I'll just write from memory.
这本书与其说是短篇小说集，不如说是生活中关于爱情的碎片收集。	This book is more of a collection of fragments about love in life than it is a compilation of short stories.
本书的笔调极其平淡，是那种白开水一样的平淡，遣词造句对简约追求到了极致，情节也是像夏日午后的大街一样，寂静平淡。	The plot of this novel is as quiet and flat as a street in the middle of a summer afternoon, the tone of the book is similar to that of plain water, and the words and sentences used strive for the utmost simplicity.
每一个短篇都是平凡生活中的一小段时间的剪影，没有开头，没有结局。	Each short narrative is a snapshot of a moment in everyday life that has no beginning or end.
最后收集在一起，冠名《当我们谈论爱情时我们在谈论什么》。	In the end, they were compiled under the heading "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."
我想，这个小说集，以及它的标题，像是一种行为艺术，作者想表达的是，爱情不止是舞台上的悲欢离合，都市传说中的海枯石烂，也不只是你侬我侬的如胶似漆，爱情不止是以上也不应该被以上代表，爱情也是平淡如水的生活，枯燥无味的日复一日，也有对生活的无措，现实的逃避，未来的茫然。	I consider the title of this anthology of novels to be a type of performance art, the author aims to convey that love is more than only the emotions experienced on stage, the rocks and dry sea in urban tales, and the bond that binds you and I together, not only should the aforementioned not be seen as a representation of love, but also of a life that is dull day in and day out, as plain as water, with a loss of life, denial of reality, and uncertainty about the future.
阅读这本书时你脑海里可能回想起你身旁吵架的夫妻，认识的人的索然无味的婚姻，以及不如意的感情。	While you read this book, images of the quarreling couples around you, the uninteresting marriages of individuals you know, and the unsatisfying relationships can be running through your head.
这正是我不推荐阅读的原因，从审美的角度上讲，本书的文笔和情节都索然无味，除非你的生活惊涛骇浪或者甜蜜得如生活在糖果城堡，否则你得阅读时的感觉就是见怪不怪和无聊。	Since the writing and plot of this book are dull from an artistic standpoint, I do not advocate reading it, unless your life is difficult or sweet, like living in a candy castle, you will feel uncomfortable when you are forced to read it, not strange and dull.
而从思想深度上，日常情节并没有让人眼前一亮或者扩展一个人的思路和视野（这点不同于马尔克斯的《霍乱时期的爱情》），短暂的片段也没有探讨任何问题，比如是什么样的错误导致了爱情的失败？	In contrast to Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera," the daily narratives did not engage viewers or broaden their perspectives in terms of depth of thought, and the brief clips did not address any issues, such as What type of error caused the failure of love?
主角婚姻的破裂来源于那些原因？	What led to the marriage of the main character's failure?
所以我不推荐阅读这本书，读不读都没什么太大意义。	Because this book doesn't make much sense whether you read it or not, I do not suggest reading it.
作者的想法更多地通过技巧和体裁表达而不是故事情节，也是本书阅读体验比较差的原因。	This book's reading experience is generally subpar since the author's thoughts are conveyed more effectively through technique and genre than through a clear narrative.
适合粗读,不能细看。	It is appropriate for skimming, not for close reading.
本书的逻辑性很好,但是内容不够丰满。	This book's logic is sound, but it lacks sufficient content.
解释了很多销售理论是什么、为什么,但在怎么办方面却很薄弱,只是指出了方向但是没有给出具体的做法。	It provides an explanation of what and why numerous sales philosophies exist, However, it is lacking in practical advice, it does not offer any concrete solutions; it only indicates the direction.
另外,本书感觉像是拼凑而成。	Furthermore, the book feels like a patchwork.
举例既有国内的又有国外的;既有知名企业家或销售员又有名不见经传的人。	There are both domestic and foreign entrepreneurs or salespeople, for example, as well as unknown individuals.
不知道是不是为了举例而编纂的故事，如果举一些作者亲历的案例会更有信服力。	I'm not sure if it's fiction compiled for the sake of illustration, but it would be more believable if certain cases experienced by the author were provided.
在顾客还是客户的称谓上变来变去。	We modify the title of customer or client.
标题上还是顾客,正文中就变成客户了。	The text becomes a customer, but the title continues to be a client.
电子书中还出现了错别字、标点符号缺失、编号错误的问题。	The e-book also contained errors, missing punctuation marks, and improper numbers.
总之,这本书作为理论入门是个不错的选择,但对于已经从事销售工作想要提高销售水平的人就不太适用了。	In essence, while this book is a fantastic introduction to theory, it is not appropriate for individuals who are currently in sales and want to enhance their sales level.
快速了解互联网金融的导读书	Understand the Internet financial guidebook quickly
这本书很浅，可以说只是一个入门课，可以帮助大家快速了解互联网金融的全貌，但要深入了解，还是要按图索骥，自己去深挖。	This book is quite brief, you could say that it serves only as an introduction to Internet finance, if you want to grasp it in depth, however, you will still need to follow the road map and do some independent research.
且成书时间较早，后来的支付宝微信借补贴大战培养用户习惯的内容还没提及，如今的第三方支付份额只怕已不是书中所说的占比这么小了吧。	Because the book was written earlier, it does not include information about Alipay and WeChat's subsidy war to shape user habits, the third-party payment share in use today is most likely not as low as the book claimed.
现在好多人外出吃饭都是带个手机就好，商家也因为银行流水太高的原因，弃用银联了。	Because the book was written earlier, it does not include information about Alipay and WeChat's subsidy war to shape user habits, the third-party payment share in use today is most likely not as low as the book claimed.
但还是非常感谢作者写出这本入门书，看得出作者起码有多年的金融观察经验，对国内外的金融发展史都十分熟悉，所以才能写成如此通俗易懂的内容。	However, I am quite appreciative to the author for penning this introduction, it is evident that the author has at least years of experience in financial observation and is well-versed in both domestic and international financial development history, as evidenced by the fact that he is able to produce such comprehensible information.
写高大空很容易，难的是写的通俗易懂。	Tall and meaningless writing is simple to do, but writing in an understandable manner is difficult.
欣赏你，更想让你知道！	I value you and wish to tell you more!
决定一个人工作满意度的第一要素不是薪水高低，而是在工作中是否得到了足够重视和赏识。	Not the amount of pay, but rather whether or not a person feels valued and given enough attention at work, is the primary determinant of job happiness.
根据马斯洛需求层次理论，在人的基本生存需要得到满足后，最迫切的就是心理需要的满足——希望被理解、被肯定、被赏识。	Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory states that when people's basic needs for survival are met, it is imperative to meet their psychological needs-- in order to feel understood, validated, and valued.
确实，对于国人来说，大部分是“爱你在心口难开”，即便是怀有爱、感激与赞赏也是默默放在心里不会说出来。	In fact, the majority of Chinese people are "I love you hard to express" people who will keep their feelings of adoration, thanks, and appreciation to themselves and refrain from expressing them out loud.
作者在本书中阐述了五种赞赏的语言：肯定的言辞、精心时刻、服务的行为、称心的礼物、身体接触。	The author of this book explains the five languages of appreciation: physical touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, and desirable gifts.
我觉得重要的不是你知道赞赏的五种语言到底是什么，而是你能随时随地发自内心地用这五种语言去赞赏，去感恩身边的人，不管是家人，朋友还是同事。	Not knowing the five languages of appreciation, in my opinion, is more significant than being able to express appreciation and gratitude to those around you whenever and wherever you are, whether they be close friends, family members, or coworkers.
其实越是亲密的人越需要赞赏和感恩，这样我们的生活才会变得更加美好。	In fact, the closer individuals are to us, the more we need to show them respect and appreciation for them, in order for our lives to improve.
学会赞赏，企业也能在一定程度上挽留住人才，降低辞职率。	Recognize your worth so that you can help businesses keep people on board longer and cut down on turnover.
感谢译者给我们带来了精彩的国外的思想和世界。	We are grateful to the translator for introducing us to such amazing foreign ideas and cultures.
由于中西方文化背景等原因，语言之间或多或少会存在差异，如果有机会能看到作者原版相信会收获更多。	There are more or less linguistic distinctions,, because of factors like the cultural backgrounds of Chinese and Western people, I think you will learn more if you have the chance to see the author's original work.
再次谢谢作者和译者以及编辑们的辛勤劳动！	Once more, I'd want to thank the authors, translators, and editors for their labor of love!
疑为伪劣商品，请亚马逊严格审核	Please conduct a thorough review, of suspected counterfeit goods by Amazon
质量超级差，包装松垮，没有分量，甚至不如路边地摊产品，没有克重，没有条码，十袋包装也是松松垮垮，完全不是合格产品的特征；是亚马逊最糟糕的购物体验，已经申请退货；完全属于质量问题；建议商家擦亮眼睛，拒绝劣质货；补充：又买了心相印，超市23元/10卷，加了几张对比照片，进一步验证了该产品的伪劣，为了给消费者更明确的参考，避免经济损失和进一步的心情不快！	The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it is not even as good as street stall products, there is no weight, there is no barcode, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose, which is not a characteristic of qualified products at all; it is the worst shopping experience I have ever had on Amazon, and I have requested a return, it is entirely a quality issue; traders should retain an open mind and shun substandard goods, supplement: I purchased a heart-to-heart, 23 yuan/10 roll from a supermarket and attached a few comparison photographs to confirm the product's authenticity, clearer references to avoid financial loss and more dissatisfaction!
再度期望亚马逊能够一丝不苟，严把商品源头。	Once more, I anticipate that Amazon will be very careful and cautious about the origin of the products.
马马虎虎的产品，和期望有差距	A gap exists between expectations and shoddy products
优点：	Benefits:
1. 大品牌，价格便宜。	1. A well-known brand, affordable price.
优点2：电机和刀片都是PANASONIC保证的，使用起来也还OK，但是和我期望有差距。	Benefit 2: PANASONIC guarantees the motor and blade, and it is safe to use, however, it falls short of my expectations.
缺点：	Disadvantages:
1. 充电没有指示灯，这个最基本你的电源指示都省下了，估计购买300元产品的客户，在松下PANASONIC的眼里，也是施舍，毫无尊重。	1. Because there is no indicator light for charging, your power indicator is essentially preserved, according to estimates, PANASONIC considers customers who purchase goods worth 300 yuan to be disrespectful and giving.
2. 有强烈的异味 充电时候，哪怕仅仅充电10分钟，就可以闻到强烈的塑胶燃烧的那种味道。	2. There is a powerful smell, even after only 10 minutes of charging, you can smell the pungent odor of burning plastic.
办公室试用了1天，搞的全屋子都是这种塑胶味道。	I gave it a try for 1 day in the office, and the entire place smelled like plastic.
和我之前用过的同价位的飞利浦PHILIPS相比，虽然多了个刀头，但是松下这款产品，质量真是对不起消费者了。	Although there is an additional cutter head compared to the PHILIPS of the same price I previously used, the quality of this Panasonic product is truly regrettable for customers.
小包装	Little Package
收到快递一看上面写着电商版就知道又掉坑里了，比超市买的小了好些，应该是M，跟商品介绍上面的图片包装不一样，所谓新版吧。	I knew it had fallen down the hole once more when I opened the express delivery and saw the e-commerce version, compared to the supermarket version, it was smaller, it ought to be M, in contrast to the product introduction picture, the package is different, the allegedly new version, the so-named new edition.
三颗星是怪自己马虎没看清楚商品规格，你卖M码电商版我没意见，你货不对版是几个意思？	I only gave it three stars because I was careless and didn't carefully read the product details, I have no issue with you offering the M-size online version for sale, what does it signify that the edition of your product is incorrect?
电商套路深，有时间还是去超市买了。	Since e-commerce processes are complex, I still go to the grocery store to make purchases when I have time.
就酱紫。	The sauce alone.
味道不喜欢	Dislike the flavor
小孩很不喜欢牙膏的味道，每次都说辣，也许用别的词形容才更贴切，小孩的词库里暂时只有这个词。	The kid doesn't particularly enjoy the flavor of toothpaste, and always claims it's spicy, perhaps a different word would be more suited to describe it, currently the child's vocabulary consists of just this one word.
搞活动时候买的，很便宜，所以也不好意思给差评了，四星吧，不过不会再买了。	I am ashamed of leaving a negative review, maybe four stars, but I won't purchase it again because I purchased it at an event and it was extremely inexpensive.
正品哟 包装好	Sincere yo, attractive packaging
包装很完整，里面加了充气袋，没有网上评论的只有光秃秃一个产品的样子。	There are no internet reviews, merely a bare product, and the packaging is very thorough, with an air bag inside.
瓶子外包装上还有一层塑料膜像图片上描述的一样，快递也很快，拍下第二天就来了。	There is still a coating of plastic film on the bottle's outside packing, as shown in the photograph, and the express shipping is also very swift, arriving the next day after I took the photo.
是正品，只是没货了，不知道什么时候再上架。	It's authentic, but it's out of stock, and I'm not sure when it'll come back.
糟心的一次购物体验	A poor shopping encounter
黑五的时候下的单，结果等了好久都没收到，后面一查询，包裹早已被签收，问了身边的同事都说没有帮签收，赶紧联系快递公司，却说要寄件方才能发起查询，联系了亚马逊客服，又等了十多天，终于搞清楚是快递被误投给别人了，又几番周转才终于取回快递，外包装已经被拆，商品还算是完整，也不知道被用过没有，总之挺糟心的	I ordered on Black Friday, but despite waiting a long time, I never got the item, the box had already been signed for when I checked it later, my coworkers denied signing for it when I questioned them about it, I called the courier service right away, but they told the sender should make the inquiry, over ten days passed after I contacted Amazon customer service, the messenger was inadvertently sent to someone else, I finally realized, I eventually recovered the courier after a few rounds, the product is still intact despite the removal of the outer packing, I'm not sure if it was ever used, No, it's still fairly horrible
错误的配图	Wrong photo
我以为自己能够收到图1这样的耳机，没想到却收到了图2这样的耳机，图物不一致也就算了，耳机左右声音大小不一又是什么意思？	I expected to get a headset similar to Figure 1, but instead I got a headset like Figure 2, the visuals being inconsistent is acceptable, but what does it imply that the volume on the left and right earbuds differ?
虽然名称都是一样的，但还是希望大家能够小心注意，另外还请亚马逊负责人及时更换正确的配图，万分感谢。	Despite the fact that the names are the same, I still hope that everyone will pay attention, to add, I also request that the Amazon administrator quickly replaces the appropriate image, I appreciate you.
操作系统一般般	Moderate operating system
用了一段时间，总体来说画面还可以，感觉不出什么差别来，就是这个系统让人看着纠结，开机时间明显有点慢，也没法进行很好的设置，再带的软件更是不用评论了，响应速度那就更一般了，和同事家的比起来那不是一个数量级的。	After using it for a while, I can't really see the difference, but overall the picture is not horrible, however this system makes people look jumbled, boots up slowly, I can't make proper settings, and the software I bring is not required, when compared to my colleagues' responses, the response time is not significantly slower after commenting.
看评论说很人性化的设计，我没有找到哪里人性化，遥控器这个常用的上下左右，返回键设计的位置实在是不敢恭维。	Although it is described as having a very user-friendly design in the comments, I couldn't discover any examples of a human-friendly design, Up, down, left, and right are the often utilized remote control directions, and the back button's placement is actually not very attractive.
所以呢，就当个电视吧，再外加电视盒之类的用吧。	So, just utilize it as a TV, and use a TV box or something similar.
降价太厉害了	The price cut is too substantial
降价太厉害了，一百多入现在99！	More than 100 yuan is now only 99, a too-strong price reduction!
在亚马逊积累了很多未评价的订单，所以我统一用复制的一段话作为评价内容。	I have a ton of unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I use a paraphrased passage as the evaluation content.
如果我用这段话来评价，说明这款产品至少85分以上。	If I evaluate based on this section, it indicates that the product has at least 85 points or higher.
而比较差的产品，我绝对不会偷懒到复制粘贴评价，这样其他消费者在购买的时候会作为参考，而商家也会因此改进商品质量。	If a product is subpar, I will never be so lazy to copy and paste reviews so that future customers can use them as a guide when making a purchase and the seller can raise the standard of the product as a result.
低价好线，不发烧就这个够了！	If you don't have a fever, this is plenty given the low price and good line
这么便宜的线，但是却应该是达到了hdmi认证标准的，亲身对比秒杀国内秋叶原这些狗屁玩意（价格都是贵一倍了），线身粗壮，也比较柔软，7米传输没有噪点，以后低价线认准倍思了！	Despite being so inexpensive, the cable should have met the requirements for HDMI certification, the cable body is thick and supple, and the transmission across the 7-meter distance is noise-free when compared to domestic Akihabara rubbish (which costs twice as much), In the future, keep an eye out for Baseus' low price line!
东西还可以，但是亚马逊的售后服务真的比其他网站差太多了	Things are fine, but Amazon's customer service is significantly inferior to that of competing websites
下单后发现下错了，但是取消订单已经取消不了，网页联系在线客服一直显示错误链接，联系不上。	I realized my error after I placed the order, but I am unable to cancel it, the incorrect link was always presented when I tried to contact the website's online customer support, so I was unable to do so.
到货后送货员给我打电话，我说我不要了，想取消订单的没取消成功，派送员就拿回去了，说先给我签收上，让我申请退货。	The delivery person contacted me after the package had been delivered, and I informed him that I no longer wanted it, when I tried to cancel an order but it was not accepted, the delivery man carried it back and asked me to sign for it before letting me request for a return.
申请退货时才告知食品类一旦签收不能退货，没办法打电话给亚马逊客服，也是一样说法，签收不能退货。	I was informed that after the food is signed for, it cannot be returned and that there is no way to contact Amazon customer service when I requested a refund, likewise, the sign cannot be exchanged in this situation.
我以前在京东和苏宁都买过政策上不能退货的物品，包括牛奶、纸尿裤等，联系客服都给退了，而且京东的纸尿裤打开后味道太大联系客服照样给退了，到了你亚马逊就不行。	I have purchased things from Jingdong and Suning, including milk and diapers, that are not returnable in accordance with the rules, when I contacted customer service, they were reimbursed, but Jingdong diapers were excessively pungent after they were opened, the customer support still responded after I called them, when you get to Amazon, you cannot do it.
规矩是死的，人是活的，联系你们客服，怎么处理的？	Rules are no longer valid, people are still living, what should you do? Contact your customer service
告诉我要么我自己收下，要么让派送员自己买下来，人家派送员本来就不容易了，我凭什么让人家掏钱买下不是自己购买的东西？	Tell me I have the option of accepting it personally, or letting the courier make the purchase on his own, why should I let the courier pay for something I didn't buy when it is not easy for the courier?
行，我也不退了，我自己收下了，但是必须给你们的服务打1分	Okay, I accept it myself and will not want a refund, but I must give your service 1 point
劝大家不要白花钱	My advice to you is to avoid wasting money
首先满怀期待购买，觉得都乐品牌的应该不会差到哪里去吧，收到了以后看包装觉得还可以，个头还不错，但是有一盒基本上都是软软的，外表看是看不出来的，要手感，吃到嘴里完全没有味道，寡淡无味，咬开来果肉一圈是暗黄色就是坏了那种，好坏参着卖的，能吃的也就不到三分之一，劝大家不要买，也不便宜，质量太差了！	I am eager to purchase it, first and foremost, the Dole brand shouldn't necessarily be awful, in my opinion, I examined the package when I first got it and deemed it adequate, the size is not bad, but there is a box that is essentially soft, which cannot be seen from the outside, to feel tasteless in the mouth after eating, bland and tasteless, the flesh surrounding the bite is dark yellow, that is the kind that is broken, good and bad are sold together, and less than one-third of the edible ones, I would advise against buying anything because it is extremely expensive and of poor quality
吃一堑长一智，以后再也不在电商买水果了！	Never again purchase fruit through online commerce after making this mistake!
产品防伪标识在哪里	Where is the security seal for the product
瓶子底部一角凹陷的厉害，应该是经历过强烈的撞击才能导致的，从外包装袋看，感觉蹂躏的程度让人揪心，毕竟是食物类的包装太简单了，而且还是属于国际购的，还有没看到什么明显的防伪标识标志，开瓶非常轻松，关键是盖内的一层蜂蜜直接从里面冒出来了，有开口几乎是没有什么粘连性，外国产品都是这样的吗？	The bottle's bottom corner is substantially dented, which should be the result of a powerful hit, from the outer packaging bag, it is alarming to see the extent of the damage, after all, despite the food's overly basic packaging, it is nevertheless sold abroad, have you noticed any blatant counterfeit prevention signs? The bottle is really simple to open, the crucial feature is that the honey layer in the top spills out right away, when there is an opening, adhesion is essentially nonexistent, are all imported goods the same?
生在中国的我有点不理解了。	I'm confused, being Chinese by birth.
应该是正品吧？	It ought to be authentic, right?
还有拍下时提示二十几号到，这个是14号收到的，我第一次在这里海外购，只是把自己的疑惑写下来，或许这都是正常的？	When I shot the picture, there was also a notification indicating it would arrive on the 20th, on the 14th, I got this one, this is my first buy from abroad, I simply noted my reservations, perhaps this is typical?
提货服务有待改进	Improved pick-up service is required
我一共买了5份提货券，在提取时，第一次预约提取3份，结果只寄过来2份，经过多方沟通才确认是漏发、答应后需补发；第二次预约，刚好赶上休息日，网站和微信均无提示需要在工作日预约，造成了不必要的恐慌，建议以后改善。	I purchased 5 delivery coupons in total, I had scheduled a time to pick up 3 coupons, but only 2 were delivered when I went to pick them up, after numerous communications, it was determined that they had been overlooked and that new copies of them were required, the second appointment arrived right on schedule, there was unnecessary worry produced because neither the website nor WeChat mentioned the need for an appointment on weekdays on the final rest day, it is advised to get better in the future.
不错的购物	Pleasant shopping
东西好评！	Nice stuff!
还是比较相信亚马逊自营的东西，现在海外购以后很方便，从国外买回来物流时间比国内也就多几天，不得不说亚马逊海外购到国内的清关能力还是很强的，比走转运要快很多，所以现在很多东西都在海外购上买。	I still have faith in Amazon's autonomous products, the shipping period is now only a few days longer than domestic ones, making it incredibly simple to purchase internationally, I must admit that Amazon still has excellent customs clearance capabilities for purchases made outside of China; this is quicker than transshipment, nowadays so many products are bought abroad, which is much faster.
希望国内商品的质量和价格能够更好一些，很多东西都是国内产的，但是出去转一圈买回来比在国内还便宜，希望改进。	I hope that domestic items' quality and cost can improve, even though many items are made domestically, buying them elsewhere rather than in China is more affordable, I want it to get better.
垃圾	Rubbish
看到这样的包裹，试问大家:觉不觉得是路边的垃圾?	I want to question everyone: Do you think this package by the side of the road is trash after seeing it?
一个塑料易碎的包装，就用一个塑料袋从所谓的德国发过来，这样的包装是负责的吗?	From the so-called Germany, a delicate plastic box is sent in a plastic bag, is a package like that accountable?
我看这样的包装是装垃圾一样的，购买这个产品，包装及其简陋，没有任何防止破损的措施，就一个简单的塑料袋包装，到手后，包裹完全变形了，里面的物品也有破损。	This kind of packaging is, in my opinion, packing garbage, when I purchased this item, the packing was quite straightforward, there was nothing in place to stop harm, it was merely a plain plastic bag, when I received it, the contents of the shipment and the entire package were entirely ruined.
如果我只是碰到一个这样的，我认了，买了几个都是这样子，找亚马逊客服，客服就说可以退，但运费垫付，然后运费以礼品卡的形式返回给我。	I will recognize it and purchase a number of these if I only come across one like it, when I contacted Amazon customer service, they informed me that the shipping price may be reimbursed but that it would first need to be paid and would then be given to me in the form of a gift card.
我试问一下，我用现金支付运费，你们给我返礼品卡，这是要我自己买你们礼品卡就直说啊，还要自己把产品邮寄到德国仓库，这不是买个产品受罪啊!	Let me ask you this: I pay the shipping charge in cash; will I receive a gift card in return, As a result, I will need to purchase your gift card on my own, I have to mail the item to the German warehouse, purchasing a thing is not illegal at all!
而我一直跟客服说，出现这样的问题是谁的责任，客服却半句不说是他们的责任，连半句责任都不敢担当，这样的售后服务还有什么保障呢? 一句话:认栽!但我估计我这个评价，亚马逊都不会给公布的机会，直接回删除!	I have been asking the customer support who is accountable for the issue, but they have refused to acknowledge any responsibility and will not even accept it for a single word, what kind of warranty is offered for this type of post-purchase support? Planted! However, I anticipate that Amazon won't allow me a chance to publish my evaluation, so I'll just erase it
质量很好5星，物流很差	Excellent quality, 5 stars but very subpar logistics
1，质量很好，秒杀的，价格适中，物超所值。	1, The price is excellent, the quality is really good, and the cost is reasonable.
2，结实、用料足、焊点牢固、表面处理得当、颜色很好。	2, Sturdy construction, ample material, solid solder joints, appropriate surface finishing, and attractive color.
3，物流是硬伤，3号下的单，11号到的。	3, The logistics are inefficient, the order was placed on March 3 and was delivered on April 11.
4，如果亚马逊没有标注预计到货时间是2月7号，我或许会很满意。	4, I might be quite happy if Amazon didn't list February 7th as the estimated arrival date.
5，但标注了预期到货时间，就相当于给用户一个承诺，当承诺无法兑现的时候，用户很难受。	5, However, indicating the anticipated arrival time equates to making a guarantee to the user, the user will feel quite uneasy if the promise cannot be kept.
6，如果你没有给予承诺的把握，请不要做出承诺。	6, If you are unsure whether to make a promise, don't make one.
7，实际上，我非常在意商家做出的承诺。	7, In reality, I am cautious about merchants' promises.
8，所以，我打了低分。	8, As a result, my grade was dismal.
金线会掉色	Color will fade from gold thread
效果还是有的，但感觉是否明显，就看个人咯，或是心理作用。	The influence is still present, but depending on the person or the psychological effect, the emotion may or may not be noticeable.
有一点不太好的，就是金色的线，本来设计出来是觉得好看，但实际上，这个金线会掉色，往车上一放，如果拿动几次，手上，和车上，会有一些金粉。	The gold thread is one item that is not ideal, although the gold thread was intended to appear attractive, it will eventually deteriorate, there will be some issues in your hands and on the car if you put it on the car and hold it a few times, a little gold dust.
希望产品可以改进。	I wish the product could be enhanced.
这种方形的，也没啥装饰效果，就不要搞金线上去，掉下来在车上弄脏车还麻烦。	Do not attach gold wires to this type of square form because they have no decorative impact and could cause problems if they came off and stained the car.
东西完好，速度可以，分2个包裹还不同包装	The goods are in good shape, and the delivery time is adequate, they come in 2 separate bundles that are broken up differently
8天的速度蛮快的，但就是2件分了2个包裹，包装还不一样，明显一个防震太多了，厚纸板贴着，封了层塑料，外包装也方便拆，一个就国内的快递盒似的，放了几个缓冲气囊就算事了，感觉有点敷衍。	8 days is a rather quick turnaround time, but it comes in 2 separate shipments for 2 items, and the packing is not the same, one is obviously too shockproof, It is secured with substantial cardboard and covered with plastic, disassembling the outside package is also simple, domestic is the other, It's like a courier box, and adding a few cushioning airbags is acceptable, albeit it feels a little pointless.
雅兰床垫真心不错	Yalan mattresses are excellent
34CM的床垫不是一般的厚，不要床直接睡床垫都可以了。	Since the mattress is only 34CM thick, you can sleep on it alone without a bed.
质量很好，不管是正面还是背面，都挺软的，睡眠很舒服，躺在上面很快就睡着了。	I immediately fell asleep while lying on it since the quality is excellent, the sleep is quite nice, and it is pretty soft whether it is the front or the back.
床垫收到后因为快递暴力运输有两处有些污渍，雅兰客服很负责，很有效率的联系解决了问题。	Due to the rough expedited transportation, there were some stains on the mattress when it was delivered.
并不是自营商品，亚马逊无耻了	Amazon is shameless, and the product is not self-operated
页面明确标注自营，实际上由供应商配送，售后由供应商负责，出问题自行联系供货商。	The self-operated label on the page is very obvious, In actuality, the provider delivers it, and the supplier is in charge of after-sales, make your own contact with the supplier if there is an issue.
想取消订单，对不起，订单信息已传递给供应商，不能取消；想退换货，在亚马逊成功申请了退换货，对不起，没有人理你，需要自行联系供货商退货。	Sorry, but once the order information has been forwarded to the supplier, it cannot be changed, if you want to return the item, and you have successfully requested a return on Amazon, I'm sorry, but nobody is concerned; you must get in touch with the provider on your own to return the item.
这尼玛哪门子自营商品。	This damn self-operating thing. What kind of thing is it?
商品不是亚马逊配送，售后亚马逊不承担，客服竟然说“我帮你联系供应商”，还声称就是自营，太无耻了，赤裸裸的不要脸，赤裸裸的对消费者进行欺诈！	Amazon does not deliver the item, and it also does not assume liability for the after-sale support, even the customer service stated that it was self-operated and said, "I will help you contact the supplier", It is clearly cheating customers and is shameless!
郁闷的体验	A miserable experience
之前在别家网购的滤芯，过滤效果不错，28天结束之后再用多一两天也一样没有水垢。	My online purchases of filter elements from different businesses have good filtration properties, I use them for an additional day or two without a scale beyond the initial 28 days.
由于一直以来在亚马逊购置的东西品质都可以，这次就想着在这边买，第一次在亚马逊买滤芯，感觉不太好，不但早早就开始有水垢，而且滤芯一直用到第28天，都会有悬浮的小黑碳粉，真不知道是继续用下去，还是直接扔了好，非常郁闷~	Since the quality of items purchased on Amazon can vary, this time consider buying on this side, the first time to buy a cartridge in Amazon does not feel very good, not only is it early to start the scale, but after the cartridge has been used for 28 days, there will be suspended small black carbon powder, I really do not know whether to continue using, or just throw away good, very depressed~
没有想象的那么好	Not what was anticipated
和我以往用过的插线板比较，外部做工一般，内部如何未拆开看，但愿如店家所描述，从使用方便性上看，每一独立单位是否通电缺少显示	The outward construction is mediocre compared to other plug-in boards I've used in the past, and the internals haven't been taken apart, I hope it matches the store's description, there is no indication of whether each autonomous unit is turned on from the standpoint of usability
包装破损了，等时间来检验产品的质量。	While waiting for the right moment to assess the product's quality, the box is damaged.
外包装破损较严重，里面的包装盒似乎是新的，但是说明书好像不是新的，九月才装修，囤货中，希望到时候不会是坏的，请亚马逊解释一下为什么好几个顾客提到包装破损，你们却能安然处之，谢谢！	While the box inside appears to be brand-new and the outer wrapping is severely damaged, the manual does not appear to be brand-new, the stock is available, yet the renovations were barely completed in September, I'm hoping it won't be damaged by then, Please elaborate on why numerous customers brought it up, although the wrapper is destroyed, you can handle it carefully, I appreciate it!
总体不错，有点小问题	Overall good with minor issue
第一次购买滤水壶，看了几篇评价文章，感觉LAICA的性价比高些就选择了这个，收到货按说明书装好了滤芯，试用了一下，感觉总体不错，但是在倒水的时候好像原水会从壶嘴的地方与处理后的水混合（原水仓密封不太严）。	This is the first water filtration jug I've ever purchased, after reading a few evaluation articles, I decided that LAICA was the most economical option, I installed the filter element after receiving the product and doing so in accordance with the directions, the treated water and raw water will be combined when released from the spout (the raw water tank is not completely sealed).
用的时候一定要等所有水过滤完再倒出！	When using, make sure to let the water finish filtering completely before emptying it!
图片不完整	Unfinished image
图片没有拍出侧面的细节，侧面的细节跟主体的风格并不一致，有很大差别，这是其一；这个珠子是泰国产的，没有标明产地，这是其二；没有标明质地，这是其三；我在英国买的时候，分明每项各有盒子，这里只有一个简简单单的塑料袋，而且珠子上面没有任何的产品标志，我哪里判断得出是真是假。	This bead is made in Thailand, but there is no indication of origin, this is two; there is no indication of texture, this is three; I purchased it in the United Kingdom, where clearly each item has a box, here there is only a simple plastic bag, and the beads lack any product logo, where I can determine whether it is true or false, The picture did not remove the side details, the side details and the main style are inconsistent, there is a significant difference, so this is one.
购买要慎重哦，尤其是买香港出来的东西。	When purchasing, especially from Hong Kong, exercise caution.
亚马逊客服真烂	Customer support on Amazon is atrocious
两天前下的订单，今天收到就发现降了40块钱，花了好多时间找到客服，客服说没法补差价，可以重买并退货。	I ordered something two days ago, and when I got it today, the price had been dropped by 40 yuan, It took me a while to locate customer support, but once I did, they told me that since I couldn't make up the difference, I could repurchase the item and return it.
这种客户体验和服务比某宝某东真是差一万倍。	Actually, this kind of customer care and experience is 10,000 times worse than that of a particular treasure.
还行，作为新手来说，值得入手	Okay, for a beginner, it's worth purchasing
品相过得去，和极品金刚没得比，之前看过商场那个价格，少说都好几百，我是第一次玩金刚，还行。	While not on par with the best King Kong, the quality is respectable, I've seen the pricing in the mall before; it's at least several hundred, King Kong is my first game, and I like it.
东西不错	Nice things
东西着实不错，送女友的，只是中午我不在加拿快递的时候有些不愉快，物流公司直接放邮件寄存宝里并且没发取件的验证短信给我，害我跑了两趟。	The item is excellent, and I presented it to my girlfriend, However, I was disappointed that I couldn't receive the quick delivery because I wasn't in Canada at noon, I had to run twice since the shipping company dropped the mail right in the treasure and did not send me a text message to confirm that I could pick up the box.
不过宝贝确实不错。	The baby though is excellent.
值得购买	Worth purchasing
小猴子可爱，亚马逊优惠力度真大，周生生官网直接发货，前天晚上下单，今天下午就收到了，真快。	The small monkey is adorable, and Amazon has excellent savings, the products are shipped directly from the Chow Sang Sang official website, I ordered it the previous evening, and I got it this afternoon, Really quickly.
邮政快递员也很负责。	The mail messenger was likewise quite responsible.
赞！	Praise!
一个顾客的告白	A client's admission
1 收到这样残次品，亚马逊客服告诉你不要急啊，我们54小时左右会跟你联系。	1 Amazon customer support advises you to not worry if you receive a product with such an issue… we will get in touch with you in around 54 hours.
2 然后中间你联系客服人员，他们会告诉你这个问题会有专员处理，他会告知你结果。	2 You then get in touch with the customer service team in the middle, who will let you know that a professional will handle this issue, and let you know the outcome.
你永远主动联系不上这个专员，也不知道她的工号，也没有直线联系电话，就是你联系不上她，只有她联系你。	Since you don't know the commissioner's job number and there isn't a direct phone number to call, you'll never make the effort to get in touch with her, She is the only one who can reach you, You can't.
3悲剧的是等了近3天，这个专员联系了我，我手机离开了一会，没有接到这个专员的电话。	3 The tragedy is that I just heard from the commissioner after waiting for almost 3 days, I left my phone unattended for a bit, but the commissioner didn't call.
我等了2个小时也没有等来那个专员的电话，期间我主动联系了亚马逊客服，并邮件发送了客服让她给我回电话。	After 2 hours of waiting, the specialist did not call, I made the decision to email Amazon customer support during this time to request a callback, I also took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service.
4近3天过去了我都还不知道亚马逊对我收到这个残次品的咖啡机，会有什么处理结果！	4 I still don't know what Amazon will do with the faulty coffee maker I received after almost 3 days have passed!

6对我来说我只能继续等待...	6 I must simply continue to wait...
底不平	Irregular bottom
因为看点评里说的都很好，所有对这款锅很有期待，拿到手的时候也很喜欢，很轻巧，但开锅的时候就发现问题了，锅底不是平的，中间突起来，周边凹下去，油都跑到周边了，特意买来的开锅大肥肉炸出好多油都没法覆盖中央区域，糊了，开锅都开不了，这样的构造估计没法正常煮菜。	Everyone is anticipating this pot because of the positive comments, When I first got it, I really liked it, although it is quite lightweight, there was an issue when I opened the pot, the pot's bottom is not perfectly flat, the oil has spread to the edges if it has sunk, Large, fatty meat that was particularly purchased is fried in so much oil that it cannot cover the entire surface of the pot.
不知道是否我运气不好，刚好拿到个底子不平的锅，幸亏亚马逊提供一个月的退货服务，果断退了。	I'm not sure if I merely received a pot with a poor foundation out of luck, Fortunately Amazon offers a 30-day return policy, so I firmly returned it.
我把锅刷得干干净净地退了，白忙活了半天。	I spent a lot of time working in vain as I scrubbed the pot clean before returning it.
好的产品设计需要匹配的制造工艺来实现	To accomplish good product design, manufacturing processes must be compatible
这是一款设计风格非常简洁的产品。	This product has a fairly straightforward design.
立方体的造型，设计师把顶部处理成微微的弧面。	The top of the cube was designed as a slightly curved surface by the designer.
本来应该是非常流畅的线条。	The lines ought to have been very slick.
可惜最终效果没有能够实现。	Unfortunately, the intended outcome was not realized.
因为顶部有两个部件，前面是控制面板，后面水盒顶盖。	Since the top is divided into two halves, the control panel is on the front and the top cover for the water tank is on the back.
顶盖的弧度和控制面板的弧度居然不一致，拼合之后出现了一个最高2mm左右的高差。	When combined, there is a height variation of up to 2mm between the top cover's and the control panel's curvatures, which are truly inconsistent.
虽然看起来是一个很小的缝隙。	despite appearing to be a modest opening.
但是可以说是把整个设计感都摧毁了。	However, one could argue that the entire sense of design has been lost.
有点心疼那个产品设计师。	The product designer is in my sympathy.
看来美的的产品经理还没有能力去打造这样的水准的产品。	It appears that the product managers at Midea are still unable to produce goods of this caliber.
（对于售后小姐的回馈当然不能要求太高，但当我听到售后说道这款产品所有的个体都是这样的，不是只有我买的这件有问题时，她的不以为然和如实重负的情绪让我明白对美的也不能要求太高） 2019-7-7水泵故障出水量少，已经第二次维修，第一次维修后两周又坏了。	(Of course, I can't expect too much from the after-sales representative, but when I heard her say that not just the product I purchased has issues, but all individuals who use it do as well, I realized that you can't expect too much from Midea), The water pump stopped working on July 7, 2019, and there was little water output, following the second repair, which was made two weeks following the first, it broke once more.
优惠后很划算，亚马逊假优惠很伤心	Extremely nice bargain after the deal, extremely unhappy Amazon false offer
宝宝出生一周购买，保温超强。	The insulation is very sturdy and was bought a week after the baby was delivered.
壶的外面摸不到一丝热量，即不怕烫到人也能有效保护温度不外散。	Even if you are not concerned about getting burned, there is no sign of heat on the outside of the pot, which successfully keeps the heat from escaping.
经过一个晚上空调房依然能保持很高的温度。	Even after a night, the air-conditioned space can continue to keep a high temperature.
亚马逊说周年活动320大优惠，后来发现大家249,289,299都有，瞬间有种被欺骗感，但是去超市对比了一下依然比同价位各种杂牌划算多了，今后外出可随车携带。	According to Amazon, the anniversary event will include 320 significant discounts, I discovered afterwards that everyone had 249, 289, and 299, I immediately felt duped, so I went to the grocery store and made a comparison.
Vitamix 维他美仕6300	Vitamix Vitamix 6300
已观望很久，看到美亚6300打折，中亚海外购同价，赶紧下手。	I've been waiting and watching for a while, and now that I've seen that Meiya 6300 is on discount and that orders made outside of Central Asia are priced similarly, I urge you to act quickly.
9月2号下单，预计到货是21号，结果12号就到了，提前了差不多10天，速度是真快！	My order, which I placed on September 2, was supposed to arrive on the 21st, but it did so on the 12th instead—nearly 10 days earlier—so the speed is really quick!
包装箱不大，直接用的是Vitamix 的原包装，亚马逊也不怕漂洋过海的摔坏了！	Amazon is not worried, about breaking the Vitamix original packaging when it is hurled across the ocean, because the packaging box is not large and is being utilized directly!
机器看着挺新，配件齐全，就是杯子放在底座上晃动的厉害，我都害怕开机杯子直接飞出去！	Although the machine appears to be brand-new and has all the necessary components, the cup shakes so violently on the base that I am frightened it may fly out when the machine is switched on!
问了一个有5200的朋友，听他描述好像没有我的这个这么松。	When I asked a buddy who also had a 5200, he said that his was not as loose as mine.
随机附带的食谱全英文，看得挺累，网上也没找到中文版，这是个麻烦事！	The recipes that come with it are all in English, which can be a nuisance to understand, and there isn't a Chinese translation online, so that's another inconvenience!
收到货后赶紧的买个了变压器，估计3天能到吧，到时候再好好折腾！	I purchased a transformer as soon as the items were delivered, It's expected to arrive in 3 days, at which point I'll throw it away!
太小，没伞套，材质一般。	The material is average, the size is very little, and there is no umbrella cover.
根本不是大号！	Absolutely not a queen size!
第二把Totes，1.这把没有伞套 2.伞柄材质一般 3.明明写Large,实际上就是一人用的便捷雨伞,两个人用估计够呛。	The subsequent Totes, 1. There is no umbrella cover on this one 2. The umbrella handle's material is ordinary 3. Despite the fact that it is labeled as Large, this umbrella is actually practical for one person, For two people, that probably isn't enough.
反而之前在美亚买的那把能三个人用无压力。	The one I previously purchased in the United States of America, on the other hand, can be comfortably utilized by three people.
感觉不太好	It's not a good sensation
首先是箱子并不怎么结实，用加按一下就变形了，其次是背面设计的平放时防止箱面的ABS刮花并起不了作用，再次是箱子里面就是一块布包着、拉杆的地方凸显出来..等等，各种不满意，最后拉链有点不顺畅。	First of all, the box is not very sturdy, with the addition of a press on the deformation, then the design of the flat rear of the box to prevent the ABS surface from scratching and fails, and lastly, the box is again cloth-wrapped inside, where the trolley bar protrudes.. And so on, there are numerous sources of unhappiness, and eventually, the zipper is not quite smooth.
PS：轮子感觉确实挺好的	PS: The wheels are really comfortable
还可以	Reasonably good
优点：这款双肩包比较精致，看起来耐用。	Benefits: This bag is more delicate, and appears to be more robust.
缺点：卡片上的二维码扫不到（搞什么鬼），15.6寸的笔记本放不下（再长一点点行不行），这款双肩包拉链可以锁起来，却不为买家准备一把锁，不可谓服务至上。	Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot fit (it could be a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but there is no lock for the customer, and it cannot be described as service-oriented.
整体还行，不认识是否是真皮	Overall it's ok, although I'm not sure if the leather is real
整体感觉还行，不认识是否是真皮，也就不能瞎评价了。	Not terrible, all things considered, I am unable to make a blind judgment because I am unsure if it is real leather.
可以装A4幅面的文件，装过80页厚的，但太厚太硬的盒状物体（不能变形的）估计装不下。	A box-shaped object that is too thick and hard (not malleable) might not be able to fit inside of it, though it can accommodate A4-sized documents, even ones with a thickness of more than 80 pages.
包很软，里面内袋分隔也比较人性化，还是相当不错的。	The inner bag divider is more user-friendly, and the bag is very soft, both of which are excellent qualities.
只是我拿到的这个底部有个小砂眼，不知道是我人品不好还是？	I recently found a small sand hole at the bottom of this, I'm not sure if my lousy character is to blame or not?
懒得折腾来回换货，忍了。	Don't complain, too lazy to toss the products back and forth.
整体打个四星，还是值的。	Overall, it merits four stars.
ForRoyal 风靡全球 相机背带 单反背带	ForRoyal is well-known worldwide for their camera straps and SLR straps
这条背带设计得比较科学，挂双肩，实用，而且胸前是用软材料固定及保护相机，不像其他快枪手那样用螺丝固定底部伤相机，而且取下摄影也很方便。	In contrast to other fast gunners, which use screws to fix the bottom to harm the camera, this strap is more scientifically constructed, hanging from the shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected with soft material, It is also extremely easy to remove the camera from this strap.
垃圾售后	Poor post-purchase support
我一个半月前买的琴，缺个零件，通知亚马逊后给了我售后的电话，多次沟通后，零件现在还没收到，请问这是什么效率！	One of the parts on the piano I bought a month and a half ago was missing, they provided me with an after-sales phone number after alerting Amazon, the part has not yet been received despite numerous communications, what class of effectiveness is this!
估计之后有问题维修更麻烦，期待好售后的朋友们还是绕道吧，太费心！	If an issue arises in the future, it is anticipated that it will be more difficult to fix, the after-sales service is too much bother, so friends who are looking forward to it should take a detour!
有小缺陷，音色不错	Little faults, excellent sound
琴头有缺陷，少了一个角，感觉是残次品，也没有任何赠品，但是这个价位已经不错了，琴的音色也不错。	The headstock is flawed, there is a missing corner, it feels like a flawed product, and there are no extras, but the price is reasonable and the piano sounds great.
还行吧，第一把面单	The initial face sheet is alright, so
用了很久，除了低音出不来，总体还不错。	Though the bass does not come through, other than that, it has been in use for a while, and the entirety is not poor.
就是做工并没有想象中的那么完美。	just that the workmanship falls short of expectations.
第一次买的时候，东西有问题，所有的灯在闪烁，无法用。	When I first purchased it, there was a problem, all of the lights were flickering, and it was inoperable.
要求换货，结果货到上海都三天了，还不送过来。	Although I requested a replacement, it took the items three days to reach Shanghai and they have still not been delivered.
给配送的打电话也不接。	The delivery person is unresponsive to calls.
快递公司说，他们只有那个联系方式。	The courier service claimed to have only that one contact.

后面又说什么中转问题。	About the transit issue, I'll speak later.
反正极差的购物体验，开始怀疑亚马逊的物流系统及控制系统的有效性。	Anyway, the incredibly bad purchasing experience led me to start questioning the efficiency of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
估计今天也拿不到。	I suppose I won't be able to collect it today.
标签粘性太差，不防水	Label adhesion is inadequate and not watertight
虽然蓝牙连接很方便，但是打印出来的内容不防水，而且表面没有覆膜；且标签粘性很差，用于线缆标签根本不行，非常容易掉下来，买来用于整理线缆的朋友需要注意一下了。	The printed content is not waterproof, the surface is not covered, and the label is highly sticky, making it unsuitable for cable labeling and very easy to come off, even if the Bluetooth connection is quite convenient, Friends who purchase it to manage wires ought to click pay attention.
笔还可以，不过包裹太简陋了，就一个纸盒子，什么保护措施都没有，而且装笔的盒子用一大块透明胶粘着，撕下来胶都在盒子上。	The pen is fine, but the packaging is overly plain, consisting of only a cardboard box with no safety measures, and the pen box is glued, with a large piece of transparent glue, which is all over the box when it is taken off.
六百元的东西就这样对待，很失望的一次购物。	This is how the 600 yuan item is handled, which is a very unsatisfactory purchase.
不过笔没问题。	However, the pen works just fine.
希望在包装上以后多改进！	Hopefully, future packaging improvements will be made!
质量没的说，若论写字，不如925-25	The caliber is subpar, It is inferior to 925-25, if the topic is writing
先赞一下天天快递吧，航空件，超迅速，服务态度也很好！	First off, kudos to the Daily Express, air components, delivered incredibly quickly, also excellent customer care!
一直在用925-25,非常棒，刚收到925-85，笔的质量没的说，样式也非常漂亮，之所以给四星是因为笔有点重，不适合快速写字，笔帽调节铅芯长度处有点晃动，个人意见：925-25要比85更顺手。	I've been utilizing 925-25, which is excellent, I recently got 925-85, The pen is of outstanding quality, and it also has a stunning aesthetic, the pen is a bit hefty and not suited for writing quickly, which is why I only rated it four stars, the lead length can be altered by the cap, 925-25 is smoother than 85, in my perspective, therefore, the place is a little shaky.
因此变成亚马逊死忠粉	Therefore becoming a devoted fan of Amazon
超级优惠的价格买的，结果孩子不喜欢点读笔。	Even though I got it for a steep discount, the kid didn't enjoy the reading pen.

耳机偏音，还有杂音	Noises can be heard and the headphones are crooked
这耳机是真垃圾，我不知道是我的耳朵出问题了，还是这个耳机确实不如从前了。	This headset is absolutely terrible, I'm not sure if my ears are off or if it's just that it's not as excellent as it once was.
我两年前在某易购买过一个蓝色的，音质还不错没有杂音低音也不错，用了两年多用坏了打算再买一个（urbeats ），毕竟感觉还不错。	Two years ago, I purchased a blue one from Xyiyi, there is no noise, and the sound quality is not awful, the bass is quite decent, I intend to purchase another one (urbeats) after using this one for more than two years, After all, it feels fantastic.
又看了出了个紫色的挺好看的，结果买来这个今天打开一听才感觉不对劲，一边声音大一边声音小。	I also saw one in purple that was quite attractive, but when I bought this one and opened it today, I got the strangest feeling.
开始我以为是那首歌音效的缘故没有多想，可后来听了半天我才发现这个问题很严重，不光偏音，低音效果也没我之前那个听起来好了，还有些许杂音，是只有我买的这个紫色的有这个现象吗？还是现在耳机制造工艺确实不行了呢?	I initially assumed it was just the song's sound effect and didn't give it much attention, but after giving it a lot of time I realized the issue was quite significant, the bass effect was not as good as my prior one, in addition to the pitch deviation, additionally, there was some noise, has the purple one I purchased had this phenomenon? Or is the current earphone manufacturing method ineffective?
相当差的评价，很失望。	Rating pretty bad, very disappointed.
明天白天一定要退货。	It has to be delivered back tomorrow during the day.
PS颜值不错	PS appears fine
此款AV功放机设置复杂，外表做工粗糙，发热量大。	This AV power amplifier has difficult settings, a rough exterior, and produces a lot of heat.
声音要用过一段时间再评！	Before making a remark, sound should be used for some time!
8月14日刚入手德版的DN1080.一看外做工好差。	On August 14, I only recently acquired the German version of DN1080. I observed shoddy workmanship.
1.前面板，旋钮都塑料的。	1. The knobs and front panel are both composed of plastic.
2.后板音频输入插口，喇叭输出端子都好差，随便找台1000-2000的CD功放一体机要比这款好太多了。	2. The speaker output connector and the audio input connection on the back panel are both quite subpar, simply locate a 1000–2000 CD power amplifier all–in–one device, it is far superior to this one.
3.顶盖比较薄，我的变压器那边还凹下去了，不得已开箱用手恢复，顶盖和前面板结合松动。	3. The side of my transformer was buried, and the top cover is comparatively thin, It needed to be manually opened up and restored, the top cover and front panel were not tightly fastened together.
4.整个机器重心偏向变压器端，搬动的时候很别扭。	4. The machine as a whole has a biased center of gravity toward the transformer end, which makes it difficult to move.
感觉是SONY入门款机器，就那做工，马来西亚出品的。	It has the impression of being a basic Sony device that was only produced in Malaysia.
感觉索尼要放在中国代工要比小马好多了。	In my opinion Sony would fare better as an OEM in China than Xiaoma.
5.机器发热大，看场电影用的两声道2个小时左右顶盖用手摸一下得有40-50℃，不知道是不是变压器太大发热量大。	5. The machine produces a lot of heat, and when you touch the top cover of the two-channel movie for around 2 hours, it's between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius, I'm not sure if the transformer produces a lot of heat or if it's just too big.
现在多用开关电源，这个傻大的变压器估计得有4KG。	The majority of power supplies used today are switching power supplies, and this ridiculously huge transformer weighs approximately 4KG.
索尼应该在机器里面用主动散热的静音风扇，开箱后只看到管子上大型铝板散热片。	Sony needs to utilize a fan that actively removes heat from the device while remaining silent, Only the sizable aluminum heat sink on the tube is visible after the package has been opened.

没拆开过	Never been opened
电池在用。	The battery is working.
很想解剖一下，看看它肚子里到底是什么。	I really want to dissect it and see what is in its stomach.
后来想想，万一拆开后很失望，花那么多钱就太冤了；万一拆开后很满意，再装起来就难了，用着就不爽了。	If you think about it afterwards, It would be unreasonable to spend that much money if you were unhappy after disassembling it; on the other hand, if you were satisfied after disassembling it, it would be challenging to rebuild and uncomfortable to use.
算了，就算索尼用的是好电芯吧。	Even though Sony is employing a quality battery cell, forget it.

我惊愕了，音质竟然是环绕3D立体！	I was astounded to discover that the sound quality was surround 3D!
我在实体通讯店问过了，差不多的30左右，但绝不是品胜牌子的，是杂牌的，因此说这款品胜虽然27块，但是性价比绝对的值得拥有！	I inquired in the actual communication store and was told that it would be around 30 or so, but it is unmistakably not the Pinsent Masons brand; instead, it is a different brand, so even if this Pinsent Masons is 27 yuan, it is well worth the money!
最差的网购体验	Worst experience with online purchasing
9月28号下单后，系统显示已经发货，结果一直等到10月12号依然没有收到货。	The system said that the order had been dispatched after it was placed on September 28, but the products weren't received until October 12.
查询亚马逊订单状态，卖家没有提供快递单号，查不到订单在哪儿。	Look at the Amazon order status, the vendor did not include an express tracking number, thus I am unable to determine the location of the order.
于是发邮件给卖家问是否能提供快递单号，过了两天一直没有回复。	So I emailed the vendor to ask whether I could share the tracking number, but after two days there was still no response.
无奈之下，打亚马逊客服，客服告诉了卖家的手机号码，我再打电话问店家，打了几次之后，电话通了，被告知快递丢件了，可以立刻再重新发我一个。	I dialed Amazon customer support out of desperation, the seller's mobile phone number was provided by customer support, I dialed the shop once more.
虽然我特别生气，但是由于电脑急需要，所以也就没跟卖家多说，只要立刻发给我就好。	Despite my intense rage, I didn't say much to the seller and simply asked for them to deliver the computer over right away because I needed it so badly.
结果，第二天打电话问，发货了吗？	I called the following day to inquire as a result: Has it been shipped?
卖家说还没，下午才能发。	Not yet, according to the vendor; it will be available in the afternoon.
我下午又打电话问，卖家说一定发，下午五六点之后发货，结果等我晚上七点打电话，电话就没人接了。	The seller told me it will be delivered after five or six in the afternoon when I called again in the afternoon, but when I called at seven in the evening, nobody picked up.
第三天上午我又打，问货发出去了吗？	I contacted once more on the morning of the third day and enquired as to whether the things had been dispatched?
可以告诉我订单号了么？	Could you let me know the order number?
卖家说没发，告诉我要是着急的话让我从别家订货，要是可以等的话下午就发。	The vendor claimed he didn't ship it and advised me to get it from another store if I needed it right away, If I could wait, he said, I could send it in the afternoon.
没办法，从别家下单又要等好久。	No way, placing an order from another store takes a lot of time.
就只能拜托卖家赶紧发货。	Just request rapid shipping from the seller.
终于在无数个电话跟踪之后，我在10月16号收到了电脑。	On October 16th, finally, after numerous phone calls, I got the computer.
至于电脑的质量怎样，我不知道，因为是给别人买的，后期再追加评论吧。	I don't know the computer's quality because I purchased it for someone else, but I will post remarks later.
刚买半年没用几次，现在已经接触不良了，询问可以给修吗？	It has a horrible contact presently, despite the fact that I've only had it for six months and haven't used it much, Can I have it fixed?
因为有台式机，买了之后没怎么用过几次。	Since I acquired it, I've occasionally not used it because I have a desktop computer.
只是出差时装包里带上用几次。	I only keep it in my work bag and occasionally utilize it.
最近发现接通电源时，不充电，需要用手左右扶几下充电器和线的连接处，才能充上电。	Recently, it was discovered that it was not charging when the power was turned on, To charge it, you had to repeatedly hold the charger's cable connection in place with your hands.
怀疑是接口处接触不良，不知道现在还能给修吗？	The interface may not be connected properly, according to speculation, can it be fixed right now, I wonder?
强烈建议亚马逊停用EMS ！	It is highly advised that Amazon turn off EMS!
商品五星，物流一星，平均三星。	Three-star average, one-star logistics, five-star product.
不懂为什么亚马逊要寄EMS，业内公认的不靠谱，好嘛，电脑好歹也是贵重物品啊！	Why Amazon wants to dispatch EMS is a mystery to me, its unreliability is acknowledged in the sector, computers are, in any case, valuable!
买后订单显示，预计20号送达，于是家里人在家等了三天！	The family waited at home for three days after placing the order, which states that delivery is anticipated for the 20th!
从厦门寄到福州，为什么要四五天啊！	Why does sending it from Xiamen to Fuzhou take four or five days!

我瞬间震惊了！	I was startled right away!

简直怀疑人生了好么！	Just questioned life, okay!
最后跑了一趟代收点才把电脑搬回来。	Finally, I returned the machine to the collecting location.
具体原因简单说就是因为快递小哥把两个单号弄反了，好在件没丢也就算了。	The item is fortunately not lost, but specifically because the courier brother just switched the two tracking numbers.
我强烈建议亚马逊不要用EMS了，以后亚马逊如果用EMS寄的快递，我一定不会再买了。	I firmly advise Amazon not to employ EMS, I won't buy it again from Amazon if they start using EMS for rapid shipping in the future.
货还不错	The products are not of poor quality
首先说一句刚买了几天就发现降价了，差评，本还算不错，性价比高，cpu和显卡足够应付主流网游和相当一部分大型单机了，散热非常好，但屏幕有点漏光(ips屏的通病)，音响质量不太好，硬盘不好(建议自己花点钱加个固态)，昨天拿去售后检测了一下硬件，没有任何问题，自带的win8.1不太好用，建议升级成10，卖家发货很快，各项询问回答的也很快，收到电脑第二天发票就到了，不错，可惜什么赠品都没有。	First and foremost, I purchased it a few days ago and discovered that the price had been dropped, the book is not bad, but the price is exorbitant, the CPU and graphics card are sufficient for most online games and a few huge single computers, the heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a bit light leaking (IPS screen) (Common problems), the audio quality is not very good, and the hard disk is not very good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state), I took it to the after-sales service yesterday to test the hardware, no problem, the built-in win8.1 is not very easy to use, It is recommended to upgrade to 10, The merchant delivered the goods immediately and responded to all inquiries promptly, after obtaining the PC, the invoice arrived the following day, not terrible, but there are no gifts unfortunately.
(顺便提一句买键盘贴膜一定不要去某宝一家叫E酷数码中心的店买，发货慢质量差，产品有问题不退不换，老板还满嘴脏话，特别曝光一下)	(By the way, you should not buy keyboard film from a store called E Cool Digital Center in a certain treasure, Delivery is sluggish, and the quality is subpar, the product will not be returned or exchanged if there is an issue with it, the boss is full of curses, allow me to disclose it)
东西很好，平台官僚依旧	The content is excellent, the platform bureaucrats persist
硬盘质量非常好，性价比绝对高，比香港买还便宜，不急着用和可以忍受物流的话绝对推荐购买。	The hard disk's quality is excellent, and the price/performance ratio is excellent, It is less expensive than purchasing in Hong Kong, It is strongly advised to purchase if you are not in a hurry and can tolerate the logistics.
但不得不说的是亚马逊平台之官僚依旧，与几年前我发誓绝对不用的时候没有改进，你永远查不到实际物流状况，信息永远是几个星期以后送到，永远不能投诉，就是这么官僚！	But I must remark that the Amazon platform's bureaucracy remains unchanged, it hasn't improved since I said I'd never use it again a couple years ago, you will never learn the true logistical situation, you can never complain because the information is always supplied after a few weeks, that's all there is to it: bureaucracy!
货收到几天了，物流信息还是10几天后你将会收到货！	It has been a few days after the items were received, and the logistics information indicates that you will receive the goods in 10 days!
物流不省心	Logistics are not cost effective
送来成这个样子，不仅包装压扁，电器包装也是开的，也不知道有没有调包。	When it was delivered in this manner, not only was the packaging flattened, but the packaging of electrical appliances was also opened, I'm not sure if there has been a package update.
FYI	FYI
还没有试用，一贯信赖飞利浦，希望电池寿命比其它牌子要长一些。	I haven't used it yet, but I always trust Philips, so I'm hoping the battery life is longer than that of other brands.
上网查了，可能是进水的通病，而且没有保修。	I looked it up online, and it appears to be a regular issue with water ingress, with no warranty.
郁闷！	Depressed!
现在裹上保鲜膜继续用，不知能用多久？	Now wrapped in plastic wrap to be used again, I'm not sure how long it can be used for?
买到别人拆开过的	Purchase the unwrapped products of others
三百多的机器要一百多的税确实比较高，看现在再六百多心里平衡多了。	It is true that a machine costing more than three hundred will pay a tax of over one hundred, observing that it is now over six hundred and so more balanced.
收到的时候封口胶条状态看着就很不对，像是拆开过，赶紧先拍了照，果然一撕就开了，打开后里面的纸板还有损坏，担心是别人退的，还没到纪念日就赶紧先给老公试试了，结果机器一点电都没有，还好刀头里面没有胡渣，要不大老远的咋退啊！	The sealing tape was in very poor shape when I got it, looking like it had been disassembled, I snapped a quick photo, and sure enough, it opened as soon as it was taken off, The cardboard inside was still harmed after being opened, I was concerned that someone else might have returned it, I soon tried it on my spouse on the anniversary, but there was no electricity at all in the machine, fortunately, the cutter head doesn't include any beard stubble, so why not send it back completely?
好不好用或者短期会不会有什么问题还未知，如前面的评价，缺货时发出的东西确实不靠谱！	It is unknown if there will be any immediate issues or if it will be simple to use, the items sent out while they are out of stock are highly unreliable, same as the previous review!
体验感中偏上水平	Intermediate to advanced level of experience
差不多顶级电动了，有很多种洁牙模式，但是很少人会天天换不同模式刷吧。	There are numerous cleaning modes on this virtually premium electric, but few users will switch their brushes between settings every day.
用了半年没有啥问题，每天刷，差不多1个多星期一冲。	It has been used for six months now without any issues, I've been brushing and flushing it every day for more than 1 week.
刷头配件在亚马逊买同样便宜。	On Amazon, brush head accessories are equally affordable.
App有点难用，除了改一下颜色那些，其他貌似兼容的问题是海外版的原因？	Except for changing the color, what other ostensibly compatible flaws making the application a little challenging to use are the causes of the international release?
希望学学大法的。	I'd like to study from Dafa.
性价比很高	very economical
已经使用了3-4次了。	I've used it 3-4 times.
1、包装完好。	1, The packing is undamaged.
2、使用非常简单，清洗也很方便。	2, It is incredibly simple to use and clean.
3、完全可以DIY理发，省钱了。	3, Saving money by DIY-ing your haircut is entirely achievable.
综上，非常成功的一次购买。	An excellent purchase, all around.
有假货	There are imitations
上次买了两包，居然是两种不同的版本，本来包装上左下角的字是绿色的，结果有一包就不是，是白色的字，结果猫猫吃了就拉肚子了。	When I most recently purchased two packs, there were actually two distinct models, initially, the lettering on the pack's lower left corner were green, but it turned out that one pack didn't have green words and had white ones instead, after consuming it, the cat experienced diarrhea as a result.
是亚马逊的货源是假的，还是发货时被员工掉包，我确定不了。	I'm not sure, if the product source on Amazon is phony, or if a delivery worker switched it.
我会再买一次，如果还是假货，我就要找你们相关人士追责了。	I will purchase it again, and if it's still a forgery, I'll find you the appropriate individuals to hold it accountable.
是横杠的！	A horizontal bar is what it is!
亚马逊图片上是斜杠的，结果给我发来是横杠的，这不是骗人吗?	Although the Amazon image has cuts, the effect is a horizontal cut, isn't it a lie?
效果还行	The outcome is not poor
猫猫喜欢吃，这是重点。	The idea is that, cats enjoy eating.
也确实有效果。	And it is effective.
紧、窄，箍脚、磨脚背。	Instep grinding, hoop feet, and tight, tiny spaces.
不推荐。	Not suggested.
1.UN是clarks最舒服的系列，可惜这款太差了。	1. Clarks' UN series is the most comfy, but this particular model is awful.
追加：今天对比了以前的UN系列鞋垫（鞋扔了垫留着用），材质比以前差了不少，弹性不如以前，透气也不如以前，就是假假的软。	Addition: Today I compared the previous UN series insoles (throw away the shoes and save the insoles), and I found that the material is significantly worse than before, the elasticity is lower, and the breathability is lower, it is also counterfeit and soft.
2.我的脚背不算高，硌的部位在脚背最高处向前3公分左右。	2. My instep is not very high, and the cruciate section is located around 3 cm in front of the instep's highest point.
3.海外购买了三双clarks，只有一双合适。	3. Only one pair of the three pairs of Clarks I purchased abroad fits.
吓得我把收藏夹里的其乐都删了。	I erased all of the music from my favorites because I was so terrified.
回头试试rockport，不行只能去ecco实体店了。	If Rockport doesn't work, try it again, otherwise you may only visit an actual Ecco store.
以次充好，品控不好	Inadequate, poor quality control
首先，值得肯定的是Prime海外购Ups很给力，31号下的单6号就收到了。	First of all, it is important to stress the strength of Ups' Prime foreign purchasing, which enabled the order to be placed on the 31st and be delivered on the 6th.
鞋子颜色比图片好看很多，皮质感觉不错。	The shoe color is much more vibrant in reality than in the photo, and the leather is comfortable.
鞋码稍大一点点，25脚长10.5宽拍的7.5W，上脚稍微有点宽松，不过平时就喜欢穿宽松一点，垫一双鞋垫刚好。	The shoe size is slightly larger, measuring 25 feet long, 10.5 broad, and 7.5W, the upper foot is a touch loose, but I often prefer to wear looser shoes, and a pair of insoles are perfect.
其次，这个鞋子品控真的不敢恭维，一只鞋底胶有破损，另外一只鞋面有各种擦痕还有个针眼，鞋面与鞋底连接处胶条错位，明摆着的以次充好！	Second, this shoe's quality control is actually not admirable, the rubber on one sole has been damaged, while the other sole's upper has numerous scratches and a pinhole, the rubber strip between the top and the sole is not where it should be!
有点后悔！	I sort of regret it!
做活动280块买到的，这个价格买到亚瑟士相当划算，当然看评论还有更低的价格。	I paid 280 yuan for it for an event, purchasing ASICS at this pricing is a steal, of course, lower pricing can be found in the comments.
现在说一下鞋子，优点：鞋子很轻，跑步挺舒服，也比较合脚，不会松松垮垮的。	Let us now discuss the shoes, Advantages: The sneakers are incredibly light, pleasant for jogging, and fit nicely without being baggy.
颜值很高但缺点也很明显：我一般穿40的鞋，这次买的40.5的，穿进去鞋子前端大概还有1个大拇指的距离，但是，这并不影响什么。	The aesthetic is excellent, but there are some evident drawbacks: I typically wear 40 shoes, but I bought 40.5 shoes this time, and there is roughly 1 thumb's gap from the front of the shoes, but this makes no difference.
这鞋很“窄”，虽然前面还留着距离，但是感觉紧紧的。	This shoe is incredibly "narrow," and despite the fact that there is still some space in the front, it feels tight.
还有一点，鞋子透气可能不太好，现在穿感觉脚很热。	Another point to consider is that the shoes may not be adequately ventilated, and it feels hot to wear them right now.
压脚背	Putting pressure on the instep
首先鞋子做工很好，值这个价。	First and foremost, the shoes' craftsmanship is excellent, and they are well worth the price.
我的脚是很标准那种，跑鞋uk7.5,eu41.5,皮鞋uk6.5,亚马逊的爱步也买过几双，从来没有出现过不合脚，但是这双我参照评论，买大一号uk7,上脚后因为大了一码长度明显偏长，但因为鞋垫太厚，还是压脚背压的厉害，加上徒步鞋非常硬，导致上脚非常难受。	My feet are pretty standard type, running shoes UK7.5, EU41.5, leather shoes UK6.5, Amazon's Aibu also bought a few pairs, there has never been an ill-fitting pair , but for this pair, I referred to the remarks and bought a freshman Size UK7, the length of the upper foot is plainly longer because it is one size larger, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses the rear of the foot very hard, and the hiking shoes are quite harsh, making the top of the foot very uncomfortable.
如果你的脚不是特别瘦那种，不推荐购买这款。	It is not recommended that you acquire this if your feet are not extremely thin.
如果一定要买，换个鞋垫也能解决，但是原配鞋垫看起来很高级的样子，不用又可惜。	You can change the insole if you have to buy it, but the original insole looks really high-end, so it's a shame not to use it.
非常完美的一次购物！	A fantastic buying experience!
非常满意，非常喜欢，亚马逊海外购都是正品毋庸置疑，质量也非常好，物美价廉，买的放心，售后服务很周到，客服态度都很亲切和蔼，处理问题耐心高效，完美解决后顾之忧，配套的快递送货上门非常便捷稳妥，送货师傅很替顾客着想，每次都会提醒及时从快递柜中取货，感谢亚马逊给顾客提供如此舒适的购物体验。	I'm quite pleased with it and enjoy it a lot, there is little doubt that Amazon's overseas purchases are genuine, and the quality is excellent, it is of great quality and reasonably priced, you can be confident that you will be able to purchase it, he after-sales service is excellent, the rapid delivery service is really convenient and secure, and the delivery master is highly mindful to consumers, He will remind you to pick up the things from the express cabinet on schedule every time, thank you Amazon for making shopping so enjoyable for your customers.

以后电子产品在亚马逊上买还是要小心。	Future electronic product purchases on Amazon should be cautious.
虽然说过去很久，但是还是要来吐吐槽。	I still want to voice my displeasure even if it's been a while.
冬天秒杀买的，不到200，放在家几个月没用。	I paid less than 200 for it in winter spikes, but keeping it at home for a few months is pointless.
春天要用的时候发现和手环怎么也连不上，两个设备说明书都表示支持对方，后来发现应该是心率带的问题，因为找来其它的设备还是连不上。	I discovered that I couldn't connect to the bracelet when I attempted to use it in the spring, the user manuals for both devices endorsed one another, later I discovered that since I was still having trouble connecting to other devices, the issue should have been with the heart rate band.
打电话亚马逊，让我联系代理公司，代理公司让我自费把设备寄去上海检测。	I called Amazon and requested them to put me in touch with the agency, who told me to pay for the shipping of the equipment to Shanghai for testing.
过了将近半个月，东西被原封原样的寄了回来，连快递盒子都是我寄过去时用的那个！	The items were sent back undamaged after almost half a month, even the express box I used to send them over was there!
没有任何回复和回执以及检测报告！	There is no response, acknowledgement or test report!
你好歹告诉一声，到底是好的还是坏的啊！	Tell me at least whether it's nice or awful!
打电话去问，说这样寄回来表示设备没问题，是好的。	When I contacted to inquire, I was informed that sending it back in this manner indicates there is no issue with the apparatus, which is good.
但是我怎么还是连不上呢，代理公司回答：那就不是他们的事了。	The agency responded, "That's not their business," when I asked why I still can't connect.
算我倒霉，懒得为了个200块的东西被你们折腾。	I'm unfortunate because I'm too lazy to be hurled by you for 200 yuan stuff.

留着用。	For future use, keep it.

本人要求周六、周日送货！	I want my package delivered on Saturday and Sunday!
亚马逊的规定不能周六，周日送货。	Delivery on Saturday and Sunday is not permitted by Amazon's policies.
害得我，从外地驱车200公里赶回来取货！	Caused me to travel 200 kilometers from the field to pick up the supplies!

尺码 物流	Dimensional Logistics
做工还可以，就是物流太慢了，以前的鞋子什么都是DHL，这次Apex真是...国内买过很多UA，价格都不低，感觉搞的比NIKE ADIDAS档次高？	The craftsmanship is good, but the logistics are too slow, the preceding shoes were all sent via DHL, Apex is truly... this time, I bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not cheap, isn't the grade greater than NIKE and ADIDAS?
其实都一样好吧，所以海淘。	They are actually all the same, so international shopping.
尺码：我身高176CM，68KG，我肩膀宽一般衣服都是180的，买的M，下摆略微长，其它穿了正好，我看有推荐S码的，身材那么纤细吗？还是喜欢紧身？我觉得帽衫还是宽松些好。	I am 68KG and 176CM tall, 180 is normally how wide my shoulders are, the hem on the M that I purchased is a little longer, others fit perfectly, I see that the S size is advised, Are you really so thin? Or would you rather a snug fit? A loose hoodie, in my opinion, is preferable.
大小正好	The perfect size
胸围99，身高184，体重84公斤，购买前咨询了客服被告知应该买xxl的，然后看了评论果断入手L的，收货后发现大小正好，差点就被坑了。	With a bust size of 99, a height of 184, and a weight of 84 kg, I was advised to get a XXL by customer care before making my purchase, however after reading customer evaluations, I chose to purchase an L, after receiving the item, I discovered that the size was perfect, and I was almost tricked.

最后爷爷给粘上的！	Grandpa finally cemented it in place!
看来以后不能买Z实惠的商品了！	Looks like I won't be purchasing Z's reasonably priced stuff in the future!
玩具加工质量不好	Poor manufacturing quality for toys
螺栓孔大部分都没对齐，上螺栓很费劲，可见加工质量不好，也不知道可以玩多长时间，因為是给孩子许诺的东西，也就不退了。	The majority of the bolt holes are out of alignment, making it difficult to put the bolts, the processing quality is poor, as can be observed, and I'm not sure how long it can be played, it will not be returned because the child was promised it in the first place.
其他评论中说安装不费劲的，难道只有我买的这一件存在问题？	Is there a problem with just the one I got when other reviews claim that installation is not difficult?
很一般	Extremely average
难道是我运气不好？	Is it my misfortune?
包装旧到不行；做工很一般；音乐只有一种而且只有8秒长度然后不断重复；动作就是摇脑袋径自往前走，没任何变化。	The packaging is dated, the workmanship is mediocre, there is just one type of music that lasts for only 8 seconds before being replayed, and the action is to shake the head and go on in the same direction with no deviation.

玩具质量不错，吐槽一下包装	Although the toy is of good quality, I must criticize the packing
昨天收到快递，亚马逊买的，标注的是EMS运送，最后是天猫的快递送过来的，这是转了多少个弯？亚马逊和天猫关系还不错？	Yesterday, the courier arrived, I ordered it from Amazon, It has an EMS delivery label on it, in the end, a courier from Tmall brought it, how many turns were required? Do Amazon and Tmall still have a good relationship?
再说一下包装，就是用保鲜膜包了几层，里面连个包装塑料泡泡纸都没有，打开一看，所有的零件就放在空荡荡的盒子里，还好玩具质量不错，没有坏掉的零件，就是比想象中的小太多了，因为不是带电池的，手推着经常脱轨，感觉轨道两边空隙太大，设计不合理。	Let's talk about the packaging once more, it's just wrapped in plastic wrap for a few layers, not even a package of plastic bubble wrap inside, when you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box, fortunately the quality of the toy is good, no broken parts, however, it is much smaller than expected because it is not battery-operated, and it frequently derails when being pushed by hand, I feel that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, and the spacing between the wheels is too wide.
质量好，好玩	High caliber and enjoyable
很好玩，组件精度很高，做工精致，质量跟乐高差不多了，做活动时价格十分优惠。	It is a lot of fun, the parts are extremely precise, the craftsmanship is excellent, the quality is comparable to Lego, and the price is extremely advantageous when engaging in activities.

他玩得惊笑连连～以后大概会继续买这个牌子的玩具。	He laughed and marveled while he played ~  will probably keep purchasing toys from this manufacturer.
机子新，海淘不错	The device is new, and international shopping is good
圣诞节有看了下，之前买的贵了150块钱，不过现发货比较慢一点。	For Christmas, I took a look at it, the one I previously purchased cost 150 yuan more, but the shipping is now a little slower.
机子还是不错的，都挺新。	The equipment is still in fantastic shape and is very new.
内置的皮卡丘。	Integrated Pikachu.
然后连接精灵球的话会送一个梦幻。	After that, if you link the genie ball, a fantasy will be sent.
玩起来还不错，比ps4，便携性高。	It's more portable than a PS4 and not horrible to play.
已经买了塞尔达，等游戏了，再试一下。	Zelda was already purchased, wait for the game, then play.
生产烂货，出售烂货，结果烂货服务，买了六块手表送孩子的，其中的一快数字显示不完全，六块的时间都不一致，相差十几个小时不等。	This was the outcome of the production of defective goods, sale of defective goods, and service of defective goods, six timepieces were purchased to be given to the children, but one of them showed partial numerals, and the time on all six watches varied by more than ten hours.
我联系厂家问手表在入库有核对时间吗?他们回复说“有”，既然有，那为啥时间相差那么多，那肯定是手表没有精确度，简单地说就是水货产品，不是我说的难听，看嘛，很明显的质量问题（数字显示不完全）都拿出来卖，是不是垃圾货。	I contacted the manufacturer and asked if there was a time check on the watch in the warehouse, they replied "yes", since there is, so then why is the time difference so much? That must be because the watch is not accurate, simply put, it is a water product, not what I said, look well, as there are very obvious quality problems (digital display is not complete) and are taken out to sell, are not junk goods.
我联系卖家，卖家说了一大堆的理由，还埋怨当初不应该买他们的东西，这样的产品，这样的卖家，这样的售后服务，以后谁还敢在亚马逊上买东西。	I got in touch with the vendor, who gave me a long list of excuses for why I shouldn't have bought their goods and lamented that no one would ever dare to purchase anything from them in the future on Amazon with such products, sellers, and after-sales service.
总之我建议不要跟此卖家买东西，买了也是垃圾东西。	To put it briefly, I advise against purchasing anything from this seller because it is also junk.
亚马逊发货问题	Shipping issues with Amazon
收到货后检查发现：	After receiving the products, investigation showed that:
1、表包装严重破旧。	1, The table packaging is severely deteriorated.
2、表说明书有严重使用褶皱。	2, The watch's instruction manual has significant use wrinkles.
3、表不走，台灯充电也无发使用，无法调整时间。	3, Because the watch does not function and the desk lamp is not used to charge it, the time cannot be altered.
4、分别联系亚马逊客服，只能自费邮寄至美国，后补邮费。	4, Contact Amazon customer support individually, and you can only mail to the United States at your own expense, with postage reimbursed later.
5、2分的原因是客服服务还不错。	5, 2 points because customer service is not subpar.
只能说还凑合	All I can say is that it isn't bad
时间不是非常准，每天约快一秒，用了才几个月已经快两分多了。	Only a few months have seen speeds more than two minutes, and time is not very accurate, moving forward by around a second per day.
以前用过一块西铁城的，感觉一两年也不会差几秒。	I've used Citizen previously, and I believe that it won't lag behind by a few seconds in a year or two.
万年历功能倒是蛮不错，计时功能有点鸡肋，基本用不到，偶尔会误触进入计时模式。	While the timing function is a bit bland and hardly ever utilized, the perpetual calendar function is pretty wonderful, on occasion, it will unintentionally switch to timing mode.
太阳能运动手表	solar-powered sports watch
优点：太阳能充电不用担心须更换电池、具备世界时间、多种闹铃及整点提醒。	Benefits: world time, a variety of alarms, and full point reminders, solar charging eliminates the need to worry about replacing the battery.
不足：镜面容易划伤、进灰尘。	Shortcomings: The mirror surface is vulnerable to dust buildup and scratches.
性价比：国内一般价格在220-300之间，海外购到手180多（用时1周左右）。	Value for money: While it costs, on average, between 220 and 300 in China, it may be acquired for more than 180 abroad (with about 1 week).
很满意的手表	Very pleased with the watch
肯定是正品，去专柜验过货，表的外观很漂亮，做工精细，用料足，加上又是进口机械机芯，所以是有一定的分量的，是那些三四百所谓的机械表不能比的，这个是货真价实的。	It has to be genuine, I went to the desk to inspect the merchandise, the watch has a lovely aesthetic, superb craftsmanship, adequate materials, and an imported mechanical movement, so it has weight, those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches are inoperable, by the way, this is the real deal.
表的走时是很准的，误差完全在可接受范围内，表的包装里有珠宝鉴定证书，表盘的12字那里是真钻石，这个自己戴很合适，作为礼品送出去也很有面子。	The watch's trip time is extremely accurate, and its error is entirely within acceptable bounds, the 12 on the dial is a genuine diamond, and a certificate of jewelry appraisal is included with the watch, both as a present and as something you may wear by yourself, this is excellent.
宾利表确实不错。	The timepieces made by Bentley are excellent.
有史以来体验最差的一次购物	One of the worst buying experiences I've ever had
9月23日晚上老婆手机摔了，心血来潮立马来亚马逊订购了一台8p，有货但是不是自营的且没有加价（心里暗喜），由于不是自营的发货比较慢，系统显示预计最晚收货要到9月27日。	My wife dropped her phone on the night of September 23rd, I ordered an 8p from Amazon on the spur of the moment, It was available, but it was not self-operated, and there was no price increase (I was secretly relieved), because non-self-operated delivery is relatively delayed, the system indicates that it is expected to be the most recent, the delivery date is September 27th.
老婆没手机用难受死了，第二天一早6点多叫我在想想办法，后来上京东一看256G有货可以当天送到，只得立马再订购一台。	My wife felt really uncomfortable with the absence of a mobile phone, I was requested to come up with a solution the next morning at 6:00 am Later, I returned to Jingdong and saw that the 256G was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I ordered another one right away.
新的买好了，就想着马上把亚马逊的订单给取消。	I planned to cancel the Amazon order as soon as I purchased the new one.
由于订单是半夜下的，没可能凌晨来收快递，7点多打给客服要求取消订单，客服答复已经取消请等待短信通知。	Because the order was placed in the middle of the night, the courier could not arrive in the early morning, I called customer service after 7 o'clock and requested that the order be cancelled, the customer support representative said that it has been canceled, and to wait for the SMS message.
好吧，我就耐心的等着，到了中午上手机一看，订单还在状态还处于未发货，就立马联系客服要求赶快取消订单，客服答复已经操作OK。	So I simply waited patiently, when I checked my phone at midday, the order was still in the status and had not been delivered, I immediately contacted the customer service and requested that the order be canceled as quickly as possible, customer service responded that the operation was well.
到了下午3点上手机一看订单还在，没办法只能再次联系客服明确告知已经第三次来电了，请取消订单并通知卖家务必不要发货！	I checked the order on my phone at 3:00 pm and saw that it was still there, I had no alternative but to contact the customer support again to inform them that this was the third call, please cancel the order and notify the seller that it will not be shipped!
客服在我要求下当场联系了卖家，并告知我卖家不熟悉系统，要等熟悉系统后再操作取消订单。	At my request, customer support contacted the seller on the spot and informed me that the seller is unfamiliar with the system and will cancel the order once he becomes acquainted with it.
但是明确告诉我卖家已经知道了，绝对不会发货的请放心。	But please reassure me that the seller is aware and will never ship if you can.
等到周一我再看订单显示，竟然已经发货了，我也是无语了。	I was in awe when I noticed that the purchase had already been dispatched when I checked the order display on Monday.
由于无法直接联系卖家，只能再次致电客服。	I can only phone customer service since I can't get in touch with the merchant directly.
后面的处理简直无语，基本都是我说一步，客服才接着操作一下。	After that, I'm just at a loss for words, in essence, I say do this action, and customer service will continue to operate.
订单到目前为止还是处于派件拒收状态，正准备再次派送！	The order is getting ready to send it again and is currently still in the delivery refusal phase!
亚马逊难道不会主动跟进下吗？	Wouldn't Amazon go out of their way to follow up?
卖家公司反正也收了钱不跟进也无所谓了。	It makes no difference if the seller's company has already collected the money and does not follow up.
总结下以后大件绝对不会预付钱了，这个样子太麻烦了。	To summarize, there will never again be prepayment for huge products, this is really too bothersome.
看起来很美好	Good looking
很久以前就看中这个摄像头了，但是因为除了价格外，还有一些别的原因，所以没有购买，这次因为凑包邮，价格也还可以所以就买了。	This camera has long since captured my heart, but I have refrained from purchasing it for reasons other than the cost, this time, I purchased it because it came with free shipping and the pricing was reasonable.
买来之后其他的都没什么问题，就是在软件连接的时候，怎么都连不上，我家是TP的路由器，上网查了之后发现好多人都有这个问题，弄了两个多小时，各种改路由器的设置，最后我用360WIFI作为媒介给弄好的，期间给小米客服打电话，他们对这个问题也没有什么解决方法，直接就让我联系亚马逊进行售后。	Other things were fine once I got it, but when the program was connected, I was unable to connect, a TP router is at my house, I discovered after searching the Internet that this issue affects a lot of people, more than two hours later, I made several adjustments, in the end, I configured the router using 360WIFI as the medium, during that time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have an answer for this issue, they merely instructed me to get in touch with Amazon for customer support.
另外一点值得注意的就是我在网上看到用户的评论说，这个摄像头支持的存储卡最小是8G，存储容量更小的就不能识别，希望大家注意这点。	A further aspect worth mentioning is that, according to user comments I read online, the least memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and memory cards with a smaller storage capacity cannot be detected, I hope everyone is paying attention to this.
用起来感觉还可以吧，画面还可以接受，但声音音质很差，机器有一定程度的发热，一直开启的话，感觉这种程度的发热有点让人难以接受。	It's comfortable to use, the picture is good, but the sound quality is bad and the machine gets hot, if it is always switched on, it feels as if this level of heat is intolerable.
综上所述，本产品还有诸多不足，希望大家买的时候要慎重。	To summarize, this product still has numerous flaws, and I hope you would be cautious while purchasing it.
之所以给3星，是因为这个是和人生的初恋买的，交往了快3年，就这样于去年离我而去了，一直到现在。	Due to the fact that I purchased it with my first love in my life, I gave it 3 stars, after almost 3 years of dating, he abruptly broke up with me last year and has not returned.
之所以给3星，是因为这个是和人生的初恋买的，现在不知道用到什么程度了，或许扔掉了吧！	I gave it 3 stars since I bought it with my first love in my life and now I'm not sure how much I've used it, so maybe toss it away!
交往了快3年，就这样于去年离我而去了，到现在一想起她，就心痛的想要离开这个世界，人生中第一个女人，带给我一辈子的阴影和心痛，迄今还没能走出来。	Almost 3 years of romance, so she left me last year, and now when I think of her, I want to quit the world, the first lady in my life, given me a lifetime of darkness and pain, and I have not been able to get out of it so far.
买这个手机的时候，想想两个当时感觉，还是能一起同甘共苦，但现在却是不堪回首，人生或许就是这样吧，有些人一辈子都不想遇到，有些事儿一辈子都不想知道，可是有什么办法呢？	I considered how the two felt at the time I got this cell phone, I could still join in their pleasures and sufferings, but I am unable to do so at this time, perhaps this is how life is, some people don't want to meet in their lifetime, and some things don't want to know in their lifetime, but what can be done?
多少次一看到三星这个手机，脑海就想起她，那种痛苦就随之而来灌满全身，我从没舍得用过超过2千元的手机，可是买给她的时候，却毫不犹豫，对一个人再好，可是有天当她变心了，所有的山盟海誓也就烟消云散了。	How many times have I seen a Samsung mobile phone and thought about her, and the agony has filled my entire body? I was never willing to use a phone worth more than 2,000 yuan, but I didn't hesitate when I bought it for her, no matter how nice you are to someone, when she changes her mind one day, all the promises will disappear.
国产品牌中的精品	The top national brands
华为是国货中的精品。	Huawei is the best of national products.
低调的老总和企业，靠的是技术和质量取胜来赢得客户，这跟当下靠广告运作来提高知名度的营商风气截然不同！	Unlike the current corporate climate, which depends on promotion to grow popularity, low-key CEOs and businesses win clients through technology and quality!
没有实力的企业根本不可能做到这样，也不敢这么做！	This is difficult for a corporation lacking in strength, and it would be foolish to attempt it!
正是源于此，我才选择了华为。	I decided on Huawei because of this.
买来用了半年多了，感觉一直很好，非常不错。	Since I purchased it more than six months ago, it continues to feel excellent all the time, very good.
之所以没有给满分，是因为有一次在用它的离线导航时，出现了不定位现象，我最终没有找出原因，其他时候都很好。	It was fine, but I didn't give it a perfect score because there was a non-location occurrence once when I was using its offline navigation, and I never did figure out why.
而且它的在线输入好了目的地，搜索之后自动设计出路线，离开wifi出发以后，它自动离线导航的功能很实用，不用跑流量，它直接跟卫星对话来实现定位及导航，非常好！	Additionally, it has entered the destination online and, after searching, creates the route automatically, after disconnecting from the Wi-Fi, its automated offline navigation feature is very helpful since it instantly communicates with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation without having to navigate through traffic, which is excellent!
索尼大法好	Sony's great approach is effective
索尼的这种低端机，设计感依旧十足，而且价格便宜，屏幕够大，续航力一级棒，给老人使用很合适。	Sony's entry-level phone still has a solid sense of design, is reasonably priced, has a sizable screen, and has exceptional battery life, the elderly will benefit much from it.
虽然时间已经过去很久了，但这机器依旧没什么毛病。	Even though time has gone, this machine is still in perfect working order.
不过因为我的Z2下放了，所以这台手机也完成了使命。	But as my Z2 is decentralized, this phone's task has also been accomplished.
